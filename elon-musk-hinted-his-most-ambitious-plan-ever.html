                        <div class="py-1 d-md-block bwr" id="video-description"><p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has released new updates about an upcoming Tesla electric vehicle. In a recent all-hands meeting, Mr. Musk told Tesla employees that the company is aiming to roll out its $25,000 hatchback in 2023. He also confirmed Tesla’s next car might not even be equipped with physical pedals and a steering wheel – which hints at a Full Self-Driving vehicle. This seems to match with what Tesla said back in 2019 when it released a teaser image of the car without pedals and a steering wheel. The company noted that the goal was to release the new Tesla vehicle within 2 years. The EV trailblazer Tesla is known for its premium electric cars like the Tesla Model S Plaid, Tesla Roadster, and Tesla Semi. Though the automaker’s other electric cars like the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y are still fairly affordable, they’re not exactly what you’d call ‘budget’ cars. For that reason, the automaker is developing a $25,000 compact electric car that is expected to be fully autonomous. During Battery Day last year, Tesla’s chief executive officer Elon Musk made it clear that the $25,000 tag is achieved through the company’s new battery cell and battery manufacturing effort, which could slash the production costs by 56%. The CEO also noted the $25k Tesla electric car would be powered by a brand-new battery design that packs more range and energy into a limited space. Apparently, that means the car will have 16% more range per kilowatt-hour of energy. Musk also promised that the upcoming budget car will be 10% lighter than conventional EVs, thanks to the new battery design, which will boost range by a further 14%. Also last year, Tesla dropped hints about establishing a new R&amp;D center to develop and build “a Chinese-style” electric car in the country. The electric car maker began taking design submissions for its Chinese-made small electric car last summer and even went on a hiring spree for the program. At the same time, the automaker released an early design of a small electric hatchback. It led many EV enthusiasts and Tesla fans to think that it was the design direction and form factor that the company is going for in its most ambitious vehicle yet.<br />Earlier this year, a section of Chinese media outlets hinted that Tesla’s more affordable vehicle than the Model 3, would likely start production tests in the second half of the year. The $25,000 Tesla electric car, which is often referred to as the ‘Tesla Model 2’, was likened to a new electric hatchback that the company has been looking to build at its Gigafactory Shanghai in China and exported to Europe and other regions of the world. Now according to sources who were also present at the company-wide meeting, Tesla’s upcoming budget vehicle will not code-named the “Model 2.” More recent reports have hinted that work on the new $25,000 electric car had also been completed and that a number of suppliers for the vehicle had already been listed ahead of production tests. Based on Musk’s recent remarks at the meeting, it’s hard to argue against the fact Tesla is building two affordable EVs – a more traditional cheaper Tesla vehicle that would be released in China and another budget-friendly car that the company is aiming to release along with a deployable full self-driving system in the United States. Whichever the case, the two vehicles are expected to be disruptive in their own way. Tesla’s $25,000 electric car— particularly one that is reportedly based on the Model 3 underpinnings, will undeniably be a substantial hit among budget-conscious EV shoppers who are seeking something that’s closer to the Tesla Model 3. Tesla has a tendency to equip its EVs with modern tech and features. Therefore, its upcoming low-price car is expected to be impressive in battery, range, performance, and tech. The Tesla $25,000 car, on the other hand, is expected to boast at least 300 miles of EPA range and do an acceleration of zero to 60mph in less than 6 seconds. A small hatchback with fully autonomous capability would also have some potential in the United States. In a typical style for CEO Elon Musk, he didn’t make any bolder claims about what this low-cost pure FSD car would be able to deliver, however, we can read between the lines. Full autonomy for the new $25,000 Tesla is no doubt the next big project for Elon Musk and his car company.
