{% raw %}The Feldmár Institute is a nonprofit organization in Hungary, established in 2006. One of its founders is Andrew Feldmár, Hungarian psychologist and psychotherapist established in Canada, honorable member of the Canadian Psychological Association.<br /><br />The Institute is a true spiritual workshop about which the founders spoke as follows: “We agree with Andrew that life before death depends on the ways someone can stay free even if there is a gun held to his or her head and on whether a person realizes that love is the total acceptance of the difference of others and true dialogue. This obviously requires courage. Love is work and courage is not equal to the lack of fear.”<br /><br />The activity of the institute is varied. As a professional and spiritual workshop, the Feldmár Institute has an active role in spreading modern psychological knowledge in society and by implementing that it helps all those who need that. The Institute organizes individual consultations, lectures, group workshops, and self-knowledge trainings. It professionally and materially supports the Shelter program of the Soteria Foundation, the method of which was elaborated by R. D. Laing.<br /><br />The Institute also publishes books in Hungary and now it would like to launch the international publishing of Andrew Feldmár’s works which have never been avaliable in foreign languages before.<br /><br />Feldmar Institute - www.feldmarintezet.hu<br />2016{% endraw %}
