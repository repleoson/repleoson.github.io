{% raw %}CAN | COULD | BE ABLE TO - Let's look at the rules! <br /><br />Hi Guys! <br /><br />In today's lesson, we're looking at CAN, COULD and BE ABLE TO. Just like other modal verbs, CAN and COULD have specific rules which can often be confusing. But don't worry, I break the grammar down into 6 steps: ability, possibility, permission, suggestions, requests and offers. <br /><br />Can you leave me a comment with an example sentence? <br /><br />Oh! And here is the link to my video for PAST MODALS. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQpM0NVM0CM&amp;t=467s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQpM0NVM0CM&amp;t=467s</a> <br /><br />If you SUBSCRIBE to my channel and turn on those NOTIFICATIONS, you'll never miss a lesson. <br /><br />Would you like to SUPPORT my channel?  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/arnel">https://ko-fi.com/arnel</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/arnelseverydayenglish/">https://www.instagram.com/arnelseverydayenglish/</a> <br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ArnelsEverydayEnglish/">https://www.facebook.com/ArnelsEverydayEnglish/</a> <br /><br />I hope this lesson is helpful!
