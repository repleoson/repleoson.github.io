How much space can you devote to the sink? If it is a small ensuite bathroom, it may not be much at all. If it is a large family bathroom, you may have more freedom to choose. It is also important to consider the practical use of a bathroom sink. To be functional it is important to allow the center of the sink to be at least 12 inches from the nearest wall to allow adequate elbow space. The height is another important consideration. It is important to have enough space for a 34-inch bathroom sink. This is the average height for all new bathroom sinks. home interior design ideas{% endraw %}
