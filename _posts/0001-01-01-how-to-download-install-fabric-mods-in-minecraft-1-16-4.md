The process is the same and it is fully working in both versions. <br /><br />This video is our complete guide on how to download and install Fabric mods in Minecraft 1.16.4. From how to install the Fabric Mod Loader to how you can install Fabric mods once you have the Fabric mod loader setup. Why would you want to install Fabric mods in Minecraft 1.16.4? Well, the answer is pretty simple. Fabric has a lot of cool mods that you can’t get with other mod loaders, and Fabric updates very fast in comparison to other mod loaders like Forge. So, here is how to get Fabric mods in Minecraft 1.16.4!<br /><br />The first step of getting Fabric mods is downloading the Fabric mod loader. You can find a link to the Fabric mod loader in the description above. Once you are there, click the ‘Download installer (Universal/.JAR)’. The Fabric mod loader will then start downloading. Depending on your browser, you will need to keep/save the file. <br /><br />After you have Fabric downloaded, we can learn how to install Fabric in Minecraft 1.16.4. To do this, right-click on the Fabric file you downloaded, click on ‘open with’, and click on ‘Java’. Then, click ‘okay’. That will open up the Fabric installer. Once you are here, confirm the Minecraft version is 1.16.4. Then, click on the ‘Install’ button. A pop-up will the come up telling you Fabric has been successfully installed. <br /><br />Congrats! You have now installed the Fabric mod loader. However, we now need to learn how to download and install Fabric mods in Minecraft 1.16.4. First things first, you will need to download a Fabric mod. We have the HWYLA mod linked in the description above. However, every single Fabric mod will be installed in the exact same way. <br /><br />You will also need to download the FabricAPI mod as pretty much all Fabric mods require this mod to work. The download process is the same as other Fabric mods. <br /><br />Once you have your Fabric mods downloaded, it is time to get them installed. To install Fabric mods in Minecraft 1.16.4, open up the start menu, and search for the ‘run’ app. Open this application, and in the text box in this app, type ‘%appdata%’, and hit enter. This will open your roaming folder. Here you will see a .minecraft folder. Open that folder, and you should have a ‘mods’ folder. If you don’t have a mods folder, just create one! Now, drag and drag the Fabric mod you want to install into this mods folder. <br /><br />At this point, you have installed Fabric mods in Minecraft 1.16.4. However, you aren’t done just yet. You still need to open up the Minecraft Launcher, click the little arrow next to the play button, click on ‘Fabric’, and click play. Minecraft 1.16.4 will now open up with Fabric mods installed! <br /><br />Congratulations! You now know how to download and install Fabric mods in Minecraft 1.16.4.
