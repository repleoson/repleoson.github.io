{% raw %}This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. In this fun and personal talk, Caroline shares a story of moving from stage-paralysis to expressive self.  Accompanied by an unusual prop, she encourages us to use our voice as an instrument and really find the confidence within. <br /><br />Caroline Goyder is an author and voice coach, with a lifelong curiosity in the question of how we find the courage to think for ourselves: aloud. Caroline trained as an actor, and then as a voice coach at Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), where she worked for ten years. She now runs a business that helps people find confidence and calm in the theatre of life. Caroline is the author of Gravitas: Communicate with Confidence, Influence and Authority (Ebury) and can be found on Twitter @carolinegoyder<br /><br />About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations){% endraw %}
