{% raw %}Lyrics:<br />Let me sleep<br />I am tired of my grief<br />And I would like you<br />To love me, to love me, to love me<br /><br />This is the night when these woods sigh<br /><br />Come with me<br />There are people who cannot speak<br />Without smiling<br /><br />They would take me from your hand<br />Or they would try, they would try<br />This is the murmur of the land<br />This is the sound of love's marching band<br />And how they hold you like a gun<br />And how I sing you like a song<br />I heard when I was young<br />And buried for a night like this<br /><br />Music:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://winteraid.com/">http://winteraid.com/</a>{% endraw %}
