My first solo video “Mr Slow Flow” was directed by Jason, he’s always been a part of my team, not just some guy for hire. Being that he moved to LA from NY recently, we knew it was time to work. The new video is jumping all over LA to narrate the lyrics through still and moving images. Jason came up with an amazing way to have it all transition together through SSUR t-shirts coming to life.
