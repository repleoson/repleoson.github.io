That’s 10,000 times more power than the planet’s population uses. So is it possible that one day the world could be completely reliant on solar energy? Richard Komp examines how solar panels convert solar energy to electrical energy. <br /><br />Lesson by Richard Komp, animation by Globizco.{% endraw %}
