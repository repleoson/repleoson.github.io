{% raw %}#Models #ModelingAgencies<br />I RESPOND TO ALL COMMENTS <br /><br />When modeling agencies look for new models to sign, they first check for a very specific set of physical criteria. Your looks are definitely the first thing agents evaluate; after all, your face and body are the backdrops for whatever fashion products a potential client is trying to sell. You're the vehicle that carries the product from idea to sale—a way for a potential consumer to imagine herself wearing it.<br /><br />First and foremost, models typically need to meet the height requirements (women 5'8 - 5'11 and men 5'11 - 6'3), for the most part, women who are slimmer than average are most in demand. Again, we're talking about mainstream here, not niche models such as petite or curve model.<br /><br />This is one reason that the modeling industry gets such a bad rap: Detractors say the call for thin models promotes an unhealthy, unrealistic body image. While this might be a valid criticism, the fashion industry’s love affair with skinny girls is not part of a conspiracy against average-sized bodies. It's important to remember that a model's job is to sell what she's wearing. Clothes hang better on a lean body and let the fashion itself take focus.<br /><br />Eyebrow Growth Serum - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/34M9IND">https://amzn.to/34M9IND</a><br /><br />FOLLOW US INSTAGRAM:<br />▪️<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/yebhe_">http://instagram.com/yebhe_</a><br />▪️<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/fresh_pepper">http://instagram.com/fresh_pepper</a><br /><br />READ<br />---------<br />▪️[eBook] How to Start a Modeling Career: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://francispolo.com/product/how-to-start-a-modeling-career/">http://francispolo.com/product/how-to-start-a-modeling-career/</a><br /><br />ALSO WATCH<br />-----------------------<br />▪️How to Build a Model Portfolio: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/y7m8B3UiwPA">https://youtu.be/y7m8B3UiwPA</a><br />▪️How to Start Modeling: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASI8qEPNzWQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASI8qEPNzWQ</a><br />▪️How to Submit to a Modeling Agency: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Wm9ZccCZQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Wm9ZccCZQ</a><br />▪️What Modeling Agencies Look For: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWeOrrSt71o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWeOrrSt71o</a><br />▪️Model Industry Lingo: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sFSv1TbYMA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sFSv1TbYMA</a>{% endraw %}
