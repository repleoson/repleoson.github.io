{% raw %}Boot Camp Digital trainer, Allison Chaney, shares her favorite tool for making virtual training interactive and engaging. <br />Our training programs are known for being highly engaging and entertaining, so when we switched to a virtual format, it was important to find tools to create the same experience. We love the Wacom Intuous tablet. It was easy to setup and only took a few minutes before we were ready to use it in our virtual digital marketing boot camp: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bootcampdigital.com/virtual">https://bootcampdigital.com/virtual</a> !<br />If you do virtual training or presentations, we highly recommend a pen tablet to use as a whiteboard and add interesting and engaging elements to your virtual experience.<br />Here's the exact pen tablet that we're using: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2X7oLij">https://amzn.to/2X7oLij</a><br />This is an affiliate link.
