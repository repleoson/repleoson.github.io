{% raw %}“For in truth neither past nor future have any existence apart from this Now; by themselves they are illusions. Life exists only at this very moment, and in this moment it is infinite and eternal. For the present moment is infinitely small; before we can measure it, it has gone, and yet it persists for ever.” - Alan Watts<br /><br />You Are Who You Are Seeking combines the brilliant speech of Alan Watts with relaxing ambient music. <br /><br />Alan Watts was a British philosopher, writer and speaker known for interpreting and popularizing Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism for a Western audience. After a rigorous research in Zen Buddhism, Watts published one of the first books on the topic – The Way of Zen – introducing the burgeoning youth culture to it. Due to all the wisdom it embodies, Watts even suggested that Buddhism could be presented and taught as a form of psychotherapy, and not only as a religion.<br /><br />To make the most of this journey, please suspend judgement and explore the natural workings of your mind. Get comfy, focus on your breath and open your mind to one of the most inspirational zen philosophers of all time.<br /><br />Best enjoyed with headphones. <br /><br />Welcome to Elements Meditation &amp; Mindfulness<br />Video Link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/GM2nRUgr9jA">https://youtu.be/GM2nRUgr9jA</a><br />The world in YOUR MIND - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DLd_osHFh6k">https://youtu.be/DLd_osHFh6k</a><br />Mastering confusion HERE &amp; NOW - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/FSMjSMLfjxs">https://youtu.be/FSMjSMLfjxs</a><br />Go with the Flow  - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/2sEh441uG-M">https://youtu.be/2sEh441uG-M</a><br />Get Your Mind Back - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSpQ4...​">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSpQ4...​</a><br /><br />CREDIT - REFFERALS<br />Featuring original speech by Alan Watts.<br />All credit for the speech goes to the Alan Watts Foundation.<br />Speech re-mastered and edited by Elements Meditation &amp; Mindfulness<br />Imagery and content from Pixabay (edited by Elements Meditation &amp; Mindfulness)<br /><br />Relaxing Music | Music For Thinking | Meditation Music | Deep Contemplation Music | Open Your Mind | Music for Consciousness | Fall Asleep Fast | Sleep Music | Relaxing Music | Sleep Meditation | Music To Help You Sleep | Ambient Music | Philosophy | Zen | Alan Watts Ambient | Alan Watts Sleep | Ego | Delta Waves <br /><br />#alanwatts<br />#zen<br />#Philosophy<br />#motivation​<br />#understanding<br />#mindfulness<br />#zen​<br />#mentalhealth​<br />#gowiththeflow<br />#ego <br />#buddhist{% endraw %}
