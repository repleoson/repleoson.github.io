{% raw %}SPY ESSENTIAL KIT - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/spyninjakit">http://bit.ly/spyninjakit</a><br /><br />After Chad Wild Clay made TWIN HACKERS? I Disguise as Hacker PZ9 &amp; Regina Pretends to be PZ2 Undercover - Life Swap Challenge, Vy Qwaint created WE TRICKED PZ9 to REVEAL HIS NAME &amp; IDENTITY - Vy &amp; Daniel Undercover in Disguise Spy Gadgets Vlog and Daniel uploaded PZ9 is ANGRY at ME over NAME REVEAL - REGINA &amp; DANIEL Spying on Hacker for 24 Hour Challenge on the Exposing Project Zorgo YouTube channel,, ex Project Zorgo member, PZ9 discovered the location of our spy ninja safe house by following our friend Dax. He claims he will tell the hacker group where we live unless we complete a bunch of challenges like Whatever You Draw I'll Buy It or Last To Leave games. Since he betrayed the PZ members, we have a plan to go on a mission adventure to figure out and real his name and face! We found out his name is Melvin! However, he still revealed our safe house address to hacker PZ2. Vy Qwaint goes on a solo mission to retrieve the important information from PZ2 before he reveals it to Project Zorgo leader. Regina goes on a mission to follow PZ9 and he almost does a face reveal! She finds out his safe house address and Vy is able to sneak into a PZ meeting and switch the spy ninjas safe house with PZ9's safe house. Regina asks for a tour of PZ9's safe house but he traps her in an empty room! Where are the video games? At least let her do some gameplay of Minecraft or Fortnite. Hopefully, Regina is able to escape.
