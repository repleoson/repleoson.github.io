In this post-apocalyptic, genre-bending series, the city of Glendale, California is populated by marauding gangs of jocks, gamers, the 4-H Club, and other fearsome tribes who are kicking ass as they fight to survive in the wake of a nuclear blast (on the night of Homecoming…ugh). Following an eclectic group of survivors as they navigate this strange and treacherous world, Daybreak is part samurai saga, part endearing coming-of-age story, and part Battle Royale.<br /><br />Daybreak (2019) is the new drama starring Colin Ford, Krysta Rodriguez and Alyvia Alyn Lind.<br /><br />Note | #Daybreak #Trailer courtesy of Netflix International B.V.. | All Rights Reserved. | #KinoCheck®{% endraw %}
