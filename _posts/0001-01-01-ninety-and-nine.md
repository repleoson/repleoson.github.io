{% raw %}Lyrics by Elizabeth Cecilia Clephane, Music by Ira Sankey<br /><br />As I always say, this one is an all-time favorite of mine. It feels like a theme to an old silent movie, where the hero wins in the end. The lyrics to the last verse are some of my favorites... &quot;All through the mountains, thunder riv'n, and up from the rocky steep...&quot; Just so cool. <br /><br />One of the COOLEST things about this hymn, which is over 100 years old, is that there exists an audio recording of the original author, Ira Sankey, singing the song himself: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbcWklq12nk.">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbcWklq12nk.</a> <br /><br />This song is a part of my newest CD, &quot;Whatever is Pure&quot;, which is available at acapeldridge.com.{% endraw %}
