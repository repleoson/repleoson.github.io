{% raw %}&quot;Deaf Safari is an audio collage of subjects that interest me and speak of the world I live in.&quot;<br /><br />support here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://felixlaband.bandcamp.com/album/deaf-safari">https://felixlaband.bandcamp.com/album/deaf-safari</a><br /><br />Title: Deaf Safari<br />Release: 29 May 2015<br />Cat.-No.: CPT 470-1/-2/-3<br />Format: 2LP incl. cardboard CD/ CD / Digital<br /><br />Artist Statement:<br />Deaf Safari is an audio collage of subjects that interest me and speak of the world I live in.<br />It is an album composed of sampled recordings from the media landscape that has been the soundtrack to my life over the last ten years.<br /><br />The most important development in my current music and as can be heard on Deaf Safari has been my understanding of the beauty and power of the spoken word. I have experienced severe indifference to contemporary pop and electronic music as a whole over the last many years, as I have felt that social comment of any relevance has been ignored by music in general.<br />Deaf Safari attempts to bring sociopolitical comment into my music without taking any specific stand. Sampled outside of musical influence directly from the news; from preacher sermons or from contemporary African documentaries.<br />I have finally created a story with sound that I feel accurately conveys my personal experience with the African world I live in.<br /><br />My musical influences on this album lie mostly with local Kwaito house. Deaf Safari is an experiment within certain boundaries of the 4/4 genre, to create my own South African &quot;house&quot; album.<br />I am proud and inspired about the South African Kwaito house scene.<br />However, as with my first three albums, &quot;Thin Shoes In June“ (2001) - &quot;4/4 Down The Stairs“ (2002) and &quot;Dark Days Exit“ (2005), I am still interested in making strange and evocative music.<br /><br />American Roots music from the earlier periods of the 20th century has deeply resonated with me during the making of this album.<br />The incredible field recordings by Alan Lomax of Negro prison and chain gang work songs, and the beautiful early recordings of artists such as Leadbelly have had a major influence on Deaf Safari.<br /><br />I am truly excited to release this album and to start performing in the music world again. It has been ten years since I released &quot;Dark Days Exit , and although I have been purposefully absent from the music world, I have none the less never stopped making music.<br />I feel that I have finally arrived at a mature and challenging stage in my pursuit of making emotional music of relevance.<br />-Felix Laband (13.02.2015)<br /><br />Links:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Felix-Laband/18041251748">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Felix-Laband/18041251748</a><br />Soundcloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/felix-laband">https://soundcloud.com/felix-laband</a><br />Resident Advisor: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/felixlaband">http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/felixlaband</a><br /><br />Compost Records: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linkin.bio/compostrecords">https://linkin.bio/compostrecords</a> // <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://compost-rec.com/">https://compost-rec.com/</a>{% endraw %}
