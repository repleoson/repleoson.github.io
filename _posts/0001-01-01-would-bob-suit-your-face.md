My name is Alyona. I was born in Russia. I'm a musician. And I love art, makeup, fashion, style and beautiful environments. I love playing with makeup and fashion, but at the same time, I‚Äôm quite a minimalistic person. I don't like the idea of being fixated on the body too much. I have an alternative and unconventional viewpoint on beauty, the body types and face shapes. I love helping other women find their &quot;it&quot; and finally discover their beauty and boost their confidence.<br /><br />I have several series on my channel that you might be interested in such as: Body Types, Contouring, Makeup History and Makeup Transformations. Also some random beauty hacks about skin care, hair, nails and beauty in general. <br /><br /><br />Love x x x<br />Aly <br /><br />TAGS: aly art, alyart, Would BOB Suit YOUR Face?, Body types, kibbe, face shape, oval, oblong, long, slim, thin, curly, afro, bob, lob, a-line bob, elongated at the front, asymmetrical, how to cut, haircut, hairstyle, curly, wavy, frizzy, volume, sleek, parting, central, side, straight, thin, thick, behind ear, trendy, 2020, trend, short, pixy, jawline, cheekbones, heart, oval, rectangular, square, trapeze, pear shape, blond, black, brown, brunette, ginger, red, balayage, highlights, chin length, triangle, reversed triangle, diamond, cheeks, big, wide, chubby, puffy, rounded, angular, soft, sharp, classic, vibe, energy, casual, style, fashion, accessory, bangs, below chin, 1-2 inches, cm, layered, blunt, symmetrical, cut, point cut,{% endraw %}
