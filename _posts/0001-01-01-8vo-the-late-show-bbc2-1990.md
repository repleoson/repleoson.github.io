{% raw %}A BBC2 profile of British design group 8vo. Hamish Muir, Mark Holt and Michael Burke set out their 1990 manifesto for the future of graphic design in seven parts: ‘Reject the past, reject style’ ’Simplify design’, ‘Type deserves animation’, ‘Use technology, not craft’, ‘Intuition, not erudition’, ‘Design is visual engineering’, ‘Forget big ideas, think content’. Unequivocal, contentious and irrascible, 8vo's challenge to the design establishment of the 1980s is as relevant and compelling today as it was then.{% endraw %}
