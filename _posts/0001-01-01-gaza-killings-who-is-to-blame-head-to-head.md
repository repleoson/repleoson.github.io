{% raw %}In this episode of Head to Head, Mehdi Hasan challenges Danny Ayalon on whether Israel is responsible for the recent killings of Palestinians following months of protests along the Gaza fence. <br /><br />Formerly a deputy foreign minister to Israel and ambassador to the United States, Ayalon has been a key player and trusted adviser in Israel's foreign policy for more than two decades. <br /><br />He has been a political adviser to three prime ministers - Ariel Sharon, Ehud Barak and, most recently, Bejamin Netanyahu.<br /><br />As the region marks the 70th anniversary of the creation of the state of Israel, which led to the expulsion of 750,000 Palestinians in what is referred to as the &quot;Nakba&quot; or &quot;catastrophe&quot;, we challenge him on whether Israel's shooting of Palestinian protesters is moral or legal. <br /><br />We also examine whether Iran is more or less of a threat since the US withdrew from the nuclear deal and if Netanyahu is undermining Israel's democracy by attempting to curtail civil rights and pushing the country to the far right.<br /><br />We are joined by a panel of three experts:<br /><br />Avi Shlaim, renowned Israeli-British historian and emeritus professor at Oxford University.<br /><br />Paul Charney, chairman of the UK Zionist Federation.<br /><br />Diana Buttu, Israeli-Palestinian lawyer and former adviser to the Palestinian Liberation Organisation.<br /><br />Editor's note: Since the recording of this programme, an investigation by Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem concluded that Israeli security forces &quot;deliberately killed&quot; Palestinian paramedic Razan al-Najjar at a protest along the Gaza fence. The episode was also recorded just before Knesset passed the controversial &quot;Jewish nation-state&quot; law on July 19. <br /><br />Gaza Killings: Who is to blame? with Danny Ayalon will be broadcast on July 20 at 20:00 GMT and will be repeated on July 21 at 12:00 GMT, July 22 at 01:00 GMT and July 22 at 06:00 GMT.<br /><br />Head to Head  is Al Jazeera's forum for ideas, a gladiatorial contest tackling big issues in front of an opinionated audience at the Oxford Union.<br /><br />More from Head to Head on:<br /> <br />YouTube - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://aje.io/headtoheadYT">http://aje.io/headtoheadYT</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/AJHeadToHead">http://facebook.com/AJHeadToHead</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/AJHeadToHead">http://twitter.com/AJHeadToHead</a><br />Website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://aljazeera.com/headtohead">http://aljazeera.com/headtohead</a><br /><br />- Subscribe to our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://aje.io/AJSubscribe">http://aje.io/AJSubscribe</a> <br />- Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AJEnglish">https://twitter.com/AJEnglish</a> <br />- Find us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera">https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera</a> <br />- Check our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/">https://www.aljazeera.com/</a>{% endraw %}
