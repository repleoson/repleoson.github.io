Here are 2 reasons why:<br />First - Parkinsonâ€™s Law. It states that - &quot;&quot;work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion&quot;&quot; meaning that more time you give to certain activity more time it will take.<br />For example, if you give yourself 3 hours to do the research then the research will take you 3 hours, if however, you give yourself 1 hour then you will get it done in 1 hour.<br />Second - Intention building. When you give a specific time frame for an upcoming task or activity then you are building intention to complete it.<br />If you know that you will hit the gym every Monday, Wednesday and Friday between 5 pm and 6:30 then you are more likely to stick with it.<br />This is why thinking in time frames and giving each activity an allocated time slot is so valuable if you want to increase your productivity.<br />As you already know there are always more things to do and not enough time to get them all done, so using your time in the most productive way is critical.<br /><br />I hope that you enjoyed this video and I was able to give you a quick summary of what Time Frame is and how you can use them to increase your productivity.     <br />________________<br /><br />Hi, My name is Janis and Iâ€™m Content Creator and Entrepreneur.<br /><br />One thing that Iâ€™m really passionate about is Time Management.
