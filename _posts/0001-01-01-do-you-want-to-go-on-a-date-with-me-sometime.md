{% raw %}Why asking a woman out on a date with confidence and certainty is way more effective when her interest is low.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this video coaching newsletter I discuss an email from a viewer who met a girl in his college calculus class. He was shy and nervous about asking her out. He got the opportunity after a few weeks, but he says he walked away like a coward instead. Then after she dropped the class, he reached out to her on social media and asked if she wanted to go on a date with him sometime. She ghosted him. He asks what he should do now.<br /><br /><br /><br />“Attraction is not a choice. Mother Nature handles attraction. Therefore, attraction is not created, but revealed. However, when romantic interest is low, a man can’t make very many mistakes that make him look weak, undesirable or unattractive without ruining his chances. When romantic interest is high, a man can say almost anything and still be successful at first because it will take a lot of mistakes and displaying a lot of weakness before he ruins his chances. Women with high interest make it easy to date and spend time with them. Women with low interest are often dismissive, difficult and unenthusiastic about making dates. Spend your time with people who celebrate and cherish spending time with you, not those who merely tolerate you.” ~ Coach Corey Wayne<br /><br /><br />Click the link below to read the article “Do You Want To Go On A Date With Me Sometime?” on my website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://understandingrelationships.com/do-you-want-to-go-on-a-date-with-me-sometime/64784">https://understandingrelationships.com/do-you-want-to-go-on-a-date-with-me-sometime/64784</a><br /><br />If you have not read my book, “How To Be A 3% Man” yet, that would be a good starting place for you.
