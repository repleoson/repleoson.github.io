{% raw %}Watch the full-length film, WiNDUP, Unity's newest animated short. WiNDUP highlights the fragile nature of life, love, and what it means to never give up. <br /><br />This film is created in real-time 3D in out-of-the-box Unity 2019.2. WiNDUP was created on standard computers by setting strict rules about poly-count and what features they could afford to use. Examples including using pixel displacement instead of tessellation shader; using joints animation instead of animation caches.<br /><br />Learn more about WiNDUP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://on.unity.com/2Z2RMx1">https://on.unity.com/2Z2RMx1</a><br /><br />For more information on the ways Unity can help you achieve your #animation goals, head over to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://on.unity.com/2Y9nnwJ.">https://on.unity.com/2Y9nnwJ.</a> <br /><br />Directed by: Yibing Jiang<br />Producers: Aleksander Karshikoff, Silvia Rasheva<br />Executive Producer: Junbo Zhang{% endraw %}
