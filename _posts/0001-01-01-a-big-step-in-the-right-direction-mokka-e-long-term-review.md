{% raw %}Yes, the Mokka-e is undeniably very, very green, but is it any good?<br /><br />It's no secret that Vauxhall, part of the Stellantis super group, are looking to reinvent themselves and the dramatic design language of the Mokka-e is evidence of this. As this green machine has been on a long term loan to the Fully Charged production crew we caught up with these camera shy folk to find out what they think.<br /><br />It's a nice, small and cheap(ish) electric car, with a few shortcomings. As it is built on a multi-energy platform (there are petrol and diesel versions) you simply don't get the back seat or boot space that a ground-up built EV can offer and when you take it out on the motorway, the range is less impressive.<br /><br />What we want to see are small, cheap electric cars built on a dedicated ev platform, and the good news is, Stellantis say they are coming. What do you think of the Mokka-e?
