{% raw %}This is my attempt at recreating the results described in an AES paper called Subwoofer positioning, orientation and calibration for large-scale sound reinforcement.

This channel focuses on the growing opportunity for live sound engineers to improve their confidence and consistency through the understanding of the principles of sound system design and optimization. My goal is to make this channel upfront and honest about my success and failure, so you can learn from both.<br /><br />I am always open to suggestions and feedback so please comment on this video or contact me through my site.{% endraw %}
