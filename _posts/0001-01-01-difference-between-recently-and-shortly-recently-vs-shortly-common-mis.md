{% raw %}Hi friends, <br />I am Himanshu Arora. In this video, I have talked about how to use  SHORTLY and RECENTLY. Watch this video thoroughly if you are confused when using 'recently' and 'shortly'?.<br />Recently (adverb) is used in the recent past. A recently published book.<br />Shortly (adverb) is used when the work is going to be done in a short time. We will be there shortly.<br />Thanks for watching.{% endraw %}
