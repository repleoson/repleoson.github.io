{% raw %}The Beanie Babies bubble is a particularly entertaining story which highlights all the hallmarks of a mania. Mass delusion. Speculation. Out of control expectations. The herd mentality.<br /><br />Right now, it might appear that we are in another collectibles boom, in February this year, a Michael Jordan basketball card sold for $738,000 at auction. The exact same card had traded for more than half a million dollars less just a few weeks earlier. A Klon Centaur guitar effects pedal is being sold for half a million dollars. At Monterrey car week a McLaren F1 just sold for over $20 million dollars, and a pair of Kanye West’s trainers that he wore to the 2008 Grammys - became history's most expensive sneakers after selling for $1.8 million<br /><br />So, should you as an investor buy beanie babies, Kanye west’s old shoes, NFT’s, meme coins or any other collectables? These are all running up in price right now, grown men are discussing their collections of Pokémon cards here on YouTube. Children’s entertainers like Logan Paul are selling cryptocurrencies and NFT’s to their audiences.  Are these items a good investment, and if so - which are the best investment?  We look at the long term returns of collectibles to see what your expected return might be?<br /><br />Patrick's Books:<br />Statistics For The Trading Floor:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3eerLA0">https://amzn.to/3eerLA0</a><br />Derivatives For The Trading Floor:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF">https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF</a><br />Corporate Finance:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC">https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC</a> <br /><br />Patreon Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance">https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance</a><br /><br />Visit our website: www.onfinance.org<br />Follow Patrick on Twitter Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/PatrickEBoyle">https://twitter.com/PatrickEBoyle</a><br /><br />Patrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:<br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b">https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b</a><br />Apple: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313</a><br />Google Podcasts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/62862nve">https://tinyurl.com/62862nve</a><br /><br />Join this channel to support making this content:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</a>{% endraw %}
