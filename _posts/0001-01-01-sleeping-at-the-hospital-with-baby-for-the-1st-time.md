{% raw %}Sooo.. it was required for me to spend the night at the hospital with Baby Jayceon after being in the NICU for 2 weeks, just to make sure things go well before taking him home permanently. <br /><br />1st of all. He's my 6th child and I literally forgot how exhausting/challenging it is having to care for a newborn. However, I'm so grateful to be able to bring my baby home. I love him so much. <br /><br />'Thank you guys for all your kind words and prayers.... Thank you for being apart of our journey &amp; for all your love and support. Our baby is homeeeee. ðŸ¥° <br /><br />Please don't forget to LIKE &amp; SHARE ðŸ˜˜{% endraw %}
