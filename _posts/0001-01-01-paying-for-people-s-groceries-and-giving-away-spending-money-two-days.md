{% raw %}It's quickly become one of our most emotional videos ever year. Paying for people's groceries the week of Christmas and giving away spending money to strangers two days before Christmas. We had such an incredible experience doing this last year and have been inspired by the charitable giving of others. Our hope is inspire you to give back and pay it forward in any way you can. <br /><br />We have been so blessed with a life greater than we ever imagined possible and we owe every bit of that to each and every one of you in our TIHWB family! For years we were living paycheck to paycheck and found ourselves many times unable to provide the necessities of life for our family including things like groceries. One year we were even the recipients of a secret Santa program and know first hand what it feels like to be down on your luck and have someone step in and provide a service for you. <br /><br />We chose the week of Christmas because two days before Christmas money is usually pretty tight. For most people they've saved hard all year and spent what money they have on gifts and things for others besides themselves. What better time to step in and pay for their Christmas needs, family groceries for Christmas dinner, and just give them a little extra spending cash for the holidays! <br /><br />Hope you and enjoy and if you were inspired maybe share this video with others! #ThisIsHowWeBingham #TIHWB<br /><br />PAYING FOR GROCERIES LAST YEAR: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/W0yVgnsxORE">https://youtu.be/W0yVgnsxORE</a><br /><br />THE VIDEO THAT INSPIRED US: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/XHcvMbYoAv4">https://youtu.be/XHcvMbYoAv4</a><br /><br />LABRANT FAM PAYING FOR GROCERIES: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/jtaP7IFhUvw">https://youtu.be/jtaP7IFhUvw</a><br /><br />Yesterday's VLOG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/puHtFURJD0E">https://youtu.be/puHtFURJD0E</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE and tell your friends ;)<br /><br />LET'S BE FAMILY EVERYWHERE!<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/ThisIsHowWeBingham">http://facebook.com/ThisIsHowWeBingham</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/ThisIsHowWeBingham">http://instagram.com/ThisIsHowWeBingham</a><br />@ThisIsHowWeBingham<br /><br />TWITCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/thisishowwebingham">https://www.twitch.tv/thisishowwebingham</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/HowWeBingham">http://twitter.com/HowWeBingham</a><br />@HowWeBingham<br /><br />Snapchat: @HowWeBingham<br /><br />Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thisishowwebingham.com">http://thisishowwebingham.com</a><br /><br />Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thisishowwebingham.com/shop">http://thisishowwebingham.com/shop</a><br /><br />BEST OF BINGHAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/dCvwFRsP1FE">https://youtu.be/dCvwFRsP1FE</a><br /><br />Mailing Address:<br />P.O.
