{% raw %}Depending on where you operate and what you haul, you will be required to obtain the appropriate permits. For example, a few states require that carriers pay an additional tax beyond their IFTA and 2290, called a Weight Distance Tax, for operating on their roads.<br /><br />It is important to be realistic about your scope of operations so that you can both save money and remain complaint out on the road.   For more information on how to obtain your own authority, please check out our other online classes on our YouTube Channel or call OOIDA at 1-800-444-5791 and ask for the Permits and Licensing Department.{% endraw %}
