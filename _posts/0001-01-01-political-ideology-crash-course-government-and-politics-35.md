{% raw %}So today Craig is going to look at political ideology in America. We're going to focus on liberals and conservatives and talk about the influencers of both of these viewpoints. Now, it's important to remember that political ideologies don't always perfectly correspond with political parties, and this correspondence becomes less and less likely over time. So, sure we can say that Democrats tend to be liberal and Republicans tend to be conservative, but we're not going to be talking about political parties in this episode. It's also important to note, that there are going to be a lot of generalizations here, as most peoples' ideologies fall on a spectrum, but we're going to try our best *crosses fingers* to summarize the most commonly held viewpoints for each of these positions as they are used pretty frequently in discussions of American politics. <br /><br />Produced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios">http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios</a><br /><br />Support is provided by Voqal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.voqal.org">http://www.voqal.org</a><br /><br />All attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...</a><br />Want to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?<br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...">http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse">http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse</a><br />Tumblr - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com">http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com</a> <br />Support Crash Course on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/crashcourse">http://patreon.com/crashcourse</a><br /><br />CC Kids: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids">http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids</a>{% endraw %}
