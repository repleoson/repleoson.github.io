{% raw %}We were called to the forest and we went down<br />A wind blew warm and eloquent<br />We were searching for the secrets of the universe<br />And we rounded up demons <br />And forced them to tell us what it all meant<br />We tied them to trees and broke them down one by one<br />And on a scrap of paper they wrote these words<br />And as we read them the sun broke through the trees<br />Dread the passage of Jesus for he will not return<br /><br />Then we headed back to our world and left the forest behind<br />Our hearts singing with all the knowledge of love<br />But somewhere somehow we lost the message along the way<br />And when we got home we bought ourselves a house<br />And we bought a car that we did not use<br />And we bought a cage and  two singing birds<br />And at night we sit and listen to the canaries song<br />For we both run rhyme out of words<br /><br />Now the stars they are all angled wrong<br />And the sun and the moon refuse to burn<br />But i remember a message in the demon's hand<br />Dread the passage of Jesus<br />He does not return...<br />He does not return...<br />He does not return...{% endraw %}
