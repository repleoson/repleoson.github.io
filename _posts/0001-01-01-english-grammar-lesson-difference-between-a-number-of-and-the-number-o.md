{% raw %}What's the Difference Between &quot;A Number Of&quot; and &quot;The Number Of&quot;?<br /><br />A few weeks ago, Rachna read through a pile of comments debating over the usage of Grammar in the article posted on the blog. <br /><br />The sentence posted in the article : &quot;Over the past few years, there have been a growing number of both peaceful and violent protests.&quot; <br /><br />Readers were confused and wanted to know if &quot;...there have been a growing number of...&quot; was correct. Shouldn't it be &quot;...there has been a growing number of...&quot;?<br /><br />This is a question that commonly confuses many ESL students! The problem is that the subject-verb agreement is different for the expressions &quot;a number of&quot; and &quot;the number of.&quot; <br /><br />In this lesson Rachna explains what should be the correct sentence - After watching the video, I hope that clears things up for you! I hope that the number of questions they have about these expressions is now zero.{% endraw %}
