{% raw %}Back through the years<br /><br />I go wonderin once again<br /><br />Back to the seasons of my youth<br /><br />I recall a box of rags that someone gave us<br /><br />And how my momma put the rags to use<br /><br />There were rags of many colors<br /><br />Every piece was small<br /><br />And I didnt have a coat<br /><br />And it was way down in the fall<br /><br />Momma sewed the rags together<br /><br />Sewin every piece with love<br /><br />She made my coat of many colors<br /><br />That I was so proud of<br /><br />As she sewed, she told a story<br /><br />From the bible, she had read<br /><br />About a coat of many colors<br /><br />Joseph wore and then she said<br /><br />Perhaps this coat will bring you<br /><br />Good luck and happiness<br /><br />And I just couldnt wait to wear it<br /><br />And momma blessed it with a kiss<br /><br />Chorus:<br /><br /><br /><br />My coat of many colors<br /><br />That my momma made for me<br /><br />Made only from rags<br /><br />But I wore it so proudly<br /><br />Although we had no money<br /><br />I was rich as I could be<br /><br />In my coat of many colors<br /><br />My momma made for me<br /><br /><br /><br />So with patches on my britches<br /><br />Holes in both my shoes<br /><br />In my coat of many colors<br /><br />I hurried off to school<br /><br />Just to find the others laughing<br /><br />And making fun of me<br /><br />In my coat of many colors<br /><br />My momma made for me<br /><br /><br /><br />And oh I couldnt understand it<br /><br />For I felt I was rich<br /><br />And I told them of the love<br /><br />My momma sewed in every stitch<br /><br />And I told em all the story<br /><br />Momma told me while she sewed<br /><br />And how my coat of many colors<br /><br />Was worth more than all their clothes<br /><br /><br /><br />But they didnt understand it<br /><br />And I tried to make them see<br /><br />That one is only poor<br /><br />Only if they choose to be<br /><br />Now I know we had no money<br /><br />But I was rich as I could be<br /><br />In my coat of many colors<br /><br />My momma made for me<br /><br />Made just for me{% endraw %}
