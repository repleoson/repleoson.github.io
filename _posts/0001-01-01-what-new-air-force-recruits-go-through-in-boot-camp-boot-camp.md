{% raw %}We got an inside look at the United States Air Force’s 7.5-week basic military training, or BMT, program. Insider spent four days at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, observing different squadrons at various stages of training. Trainees are instructed in marksmanship, drill, and battlefield first aid. The program culminates in week six with an event known as BEAST (Basic Expeditionary Airman Skills Training). During BEAST week, trainees live in a simulated combat environment and are tested in various field training exercises and scenarios. We talked to trainees and members of Air Force leadership about the lessons taught in Air Force BMT, along with the humorous nickname bestowed on the Air Force by members of other branches: “Chair Force.”<br /><br />MORE BOOT CAMP VIDEOS:<br />What New Air Force Cadets Go Through On Day One At The Academy | Boot Camp<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LYEB6_MW04">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LYEB6_MW04</a><br />What Army Paratroopers Go Through At Airborne School | Boot Camp<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMDQAmRtQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMDQAmRtQ</a><br />How Marine Corps Drill Instructors Are Trained | Boot Camp<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPr-SIL6BiQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPr-SIL6BiQ</a><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />#AirForce #Bootcamp #BusinessInsider<br /><br />Business Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.<br /><br />Visit us at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com">https://www.businessinsider.com</a><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/businessinsider">https://www.youtube.com/user/businessinsider</a><br />BI on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://read.bi/2xOcEcj">https://read.bi/2xOcEcj</a><br />BI on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://read.bi/2Q2D29T">https://read.bi/2Q2D29T</a><br />BI on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://read.bi/2xCnzGF">https://read.bi/2xCnzGF</a><br /><br />What New Air Force Recruits Go Through In Boot Camp | Boot Camp{% endraw %}
