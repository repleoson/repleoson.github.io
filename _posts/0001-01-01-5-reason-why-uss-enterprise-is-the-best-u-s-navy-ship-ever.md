{% raw %}In May 1938, the U.S. Navy commissioned the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, the seventh ship to bear the name in American service. The second of three sisters, Enterprise made a central—perhaps the central—contribution to the war effort in 1942. The U.S. Navy began 1942 with six fleet carriers (excluding the small Ranger, which served in the Atlantic). Over the course of the year, Japanese aircraft and submarines would sink four of those carriers and put a fifth (USS Saratoga) out of action for long periods of time. Enterprise fought with distinction in most of the major battles of 1942 and survived to contribute for the rest of the war.<br /><br />Popular: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9bsSs9V_bLE">https://youtu.be/9bsSs9V_bLE</a><br /><br />Recent Video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/WdTyQ5jEE1E">https://youtu.be/WdTyQ5jEE1E</a><br /><br />#usmilitarytechnology #militaryvideo #{% endraw %}
