{% raw %}In this video we will be tearing down the Toyota 2AR-FE engine to see what's inside and how it works! We'll also aim to appreciate its simplicity and what makes it modern, efficient and reliable that Toyota has been using it for a decade in many of its mainstream vehicles. <br /><br /><br />The 2AR-FE is a 2.5L 4 cylinder engine that debuted in the Toyota RAV4 in 2008. It was used in Toyota's highest selling Camry and RAV4 vehicles as well as the Scion tC. The all aluminum engine features dual variable valve timing, with a timing chain, variable intake runners and a balance shaft, among other upgrades from its 2AZ-FE 2.4L predecessor. <br /><br /><br />The unlike its predecessor, the 2AR-FE has been tested for many years and miles and did not have major issues, making it one of Toyota's more reliable choices when searching for a used vehicle.<br /><br /><br />Skip to section in the video:<br />0:00 Introduction<br />0:25 Valvetrain<br />4:48 Air intake<br />6:02 Engine Block<br />10:17 Oil Lubrication<br />11:25 Balance Shaft<br />12:18 Engine Head<br />13:32 Valve Cover<br />13:51 Conclusion<br /><br /><br />Keep your Toyota well maintained with tools and parts that can be purchased here:<br />2AR-FE Engine Oil Filter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3fkpR4b">https://amzn.to/3fkpR4b</a> (US)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3cuzSKk">https://amzn.to/3cuzSKk</a> (Canada)<br />Toyota Oil Filter Wrench:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ruUIx2">https://amzn.to/3ruUIx2</a> (US)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/31s0nd0">https://amzn.to/31s0nd0</a> (Canada)<br />3/8&quot; Drive Socket and Ratchet Set:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3u5c1H1">https://amzn.to/3u5c1H1</a> (US)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3swppDp">https://amzn.to/3swppDp</a> (Canada)<br /><br /><br /><br />This is the Camera I use:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Y24ixX">https://amzn.to/2Y24ixX</a> (US)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Yhb3eo">https://amzn.to/2Yhb3eo</a> (Canada)<br /><br />Link to Etsy shop where you can purchase speedkar99's brother's socks, t-shirts or hoodies: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/Speedkar">https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/Speedkar</a><br /><br />Check out the speedkar99 Facebook page:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/speedkar9/">https://www.facebook.com/speedkar9/</a><br /><br />Check out the speedkar99 Linkedin page:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/speedkar99/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/speedkar99/</a><br /><br />Follow speedkar9 on Instagram for behind the scenes coverage:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/speedkar9/">https://www.instagram.com/speedkar9/</a><br /><br />Subscribe for more videos just like this:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=speedkar99">https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=speedkar99</a>{% endraw %}
