{% raw %}Carol Banawa<br /><br />Album : TRANSITION 2001<br /><br /><br /><br />Carol Banawa<br /><br />Q uandary lyrics<br /><br />What is strange new feeling that Ive never before<br /><br />Could my hearts beating be revealing <br /><br />Feelings unexplored<br /><br />When first I saw you standing there<br /><br />A sailor, prince or king<br /><br />With such a strong commanding air<br /><br />You seemed to shine over everything<br /><br /><br /><br />And when you raised your voice<br /><br />It seemed to echo all around<br /><br />You sang of all your joys<br /><br />And of the love you havent hound <br /><br />And hearing of your hearts desire<br /><br />A stirring uncontrolled<br /><br />Burst from within like fatal fire<br /><br />Is this what they call<br /><br />Love with all your soul<br /><br /><br /><br />How can  a human know what I dont know<br /><br />How can a human soul enchant me so<br /><br /> <br /><br />Or can it be the joy this man expresses <br /><br />Faith he professes is a guarantee <br /><br />He could learn to love <br /><br />someone like me <br /><br /><br /><br />But as I hold you close like this <br /><br />You calm my strange unease <br /><br />If I should wake you with a kiss <br /><br />Would you lead me to <br /><br />Such a love, oh please <br /><br /><br /><br />How can a human know <br /><br />what i don't know <br /><br />How can a human soul <br /><br />enchant me so <br /><br />Or can it be the joy this man expresses <br /><br />Faith he professes is a guarantee <br /><br />He could learn to love <br /><br />someone like me{% endraw %}
