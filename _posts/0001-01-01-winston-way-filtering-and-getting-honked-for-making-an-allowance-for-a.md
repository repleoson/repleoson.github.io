{% raw %}Another morning traffic queue along Winston Way and down Ilford Hill.  Approaching the junction for the North Circular I was aware of the lorry and guessed they might be planning to merge left before the signal came on.  Of course when it did, it made sense to me to leave them room.  The driver behind me I guess just didn't see it that way, so I had to point out the lorry to them.{% endraw %}
