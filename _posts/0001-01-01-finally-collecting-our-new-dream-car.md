{% raw %}Finally Collecting Our NEW DREAM CAR!? A few weeks ago I posted a video saying I had to sell my Porsche... and it was a very emotional day as I absolutely loved that car! but all good things come to an end and selling the Porsche 718 Cayman GTS was the right thing to do at the time... having been looking for a replacement car for some time and tested a few different cars including Aston Martin Vantage, Jaguar F-Type, Porsche 911 Carerra and even a Hot hatch VW Golf R... I finally came to a decision and we bought our new dream car!!!!{% endraw %}
