{% raw %}There are people that don’t have an understanding of the times. They don’t know the day in which they are living. They live life blindly. They think that all they see is all there is. But all that you see is not all there is. When you have an understanding of the times you will know what you ought to do. We must understand what day are we living? What is the move of the Spirit today? What does God want us to do today? What is the Spirit’s direction for today? We have to look in the spirit through the power of the Holy Ghost with the understanding of the times then we will be instructed in the direction in which we should go. Your Christian growth is measured by how close you are in your life to walking in the will of the Father. <br /><br />This is yet another explosive message exposition by Pastor Chris Oyakhlome.
