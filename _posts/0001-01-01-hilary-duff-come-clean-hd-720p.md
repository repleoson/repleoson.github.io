It was written by Kara DioGuardi and John Shanks, while production was handled by Shanks. The song contains influences of electronica, with the lyrics chronicling the protagonist wanting to &quot;come clean&quot; with her love interest, from a strained relationship. &quot;Come Clean&quot; was received by critics with mixed reviews. The song was released on January 13, 2004 as the album's second single.<br /><br />In the United States, the song peaked at number thirty-five, becoming Duff's first top forty single on the Billboard Hot 100. It would later go on to become her best-selling single in the United States.[1] However, the song failed to match the success of its predecessor &quot;So Yesterday&quot; in many other countries. It reached a peak of number seventeen in Australia and eighteen in the UK, while charting inside top twenty in Canada, Netherlands, Ireland and New Zealand. A remix of the song by Chris Cox was included in Duff's 2005 compilation album, Most Wanted, this version was also included on her Dignity Walmart edition Remix EP as the Dance Mix in 2007, and in 2008, another remix of the song by Chico Bennett &amp; Richard &quot;Humpty&quot; Vission was included in Best of Hilary Duff.<br /><br />The song was accompanied by a music video, directed Dave Meyers, which showed Duff inside a house on a rainy day, waiting for her love interest. The video was nominated in the category of Best Pop Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards. The song was used in the theatrical trailer for the 2004 film A Cinderella Story, which stars Duff. It was used as the theme song for the MTV reality television shows Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County and Newport Harbor: The Real Orange County, and it is included on the soundtrack album for Laguna Beach.<br /><br />As featured on 'Metamorphosis' Album.
