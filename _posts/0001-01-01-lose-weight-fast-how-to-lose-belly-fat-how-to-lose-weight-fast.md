{% raw %}Lose weight fast. This video is on how to lose belly fat, how to lose weight fast, lose weight and weight loss diet.<br /><br />This weeks video is a two part episode on how to lose weight and belly fat. This episode will be focusing on dietary advice, the second episode will be focusing on exercises. I've received a lot of messages and comments to make a video on this topic and now it's finally ready. I really hope my tips help you and always remember you’re awesome!<br /><br />WHAT IS BELLY FAT:<br />You see the problem is that fat, isn’t just the inch you can pinch known as subcutaneous fat the real danger is the fat that’s in your abdomen and surrounding your internal organs known as visceral fat. Studies have shown visceral fat puts us at higher risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and in women it’s even shown to increase the risk of breast cancer.<br /><br />DIET PORTION SIZE EXPLAINED:<br />Now this diet comes from a study done in Oxford and to help participants reduce the amount they were eating, they were encouraged to measure portions based on the size of their hands.<br /><br />They aimed for a daily intake of, <br />• Three fist-sized servings of carbohydrates (Examples: Pasta, rice, potatoes, breakfast cereals, bread, wholegrains e.g. bulgur wheat, quinoa)<br /><br />• Two palm-sized servings of lean protein (Examples: Fish, meat, poultry, eggs, nuts, soya products e.g. tofu, quorn, legumes and pulses e.g. lentils, kidney beans)<br /><br />• Two cupped handfuls of vegetables or salad (Examples: All kinds of green and root vegetables (not potatoes) and salad vegetables)<br /><br />• Two fist-sized servings of fruit (Examples: Any fresh, frozen or fruit canned in natural juice or water)<br /><br />• Two servings of fat or oil covering the tip of the thumb (Examples; Any vegetable oil, butter or fat spreads.)<br /><br />Aim to have some dairy in your diet, participants could have 200ml/⅓ pint skimmed or semi-skimmed milk, or two 125g pots of natural or low-calorie yoghurt.<br /><br />Please note: If you really like cheese you can have it in your diet but remember its a protein food so it should substitute the proteins servings. Please remember for cheese one serving is the size of a matchbox, little pocket sized ones not the big cooking ones.<br /><br />For more information on healthy balanced diets and a full list of the different food groups: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/">https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/</a><br /><br />RESULTS:<br />The results from the study were pretty incredible participants lost 0.5 to 1kg every week if done correctly!<br /><br />But here’s the best part, after 6 weeks the study showed that each individual also reduced their,<br />• Dangerous visceral fat by 14%<br />• Cholesterol<br />• Blood pressure<br />• Had a 5cm reduction in their waistline<br /><br />And this is all without any extra exercise just by using a very simple portion sizing technique.<br /><br />PART TWO OF THIS VIDEO:<br />As explained this is going to be a two part video this episode will be focusing on dietary advice, the second episode will be focusing on exercises and can be found at the following link: (This will be updated when the video is live)<br /><br />BMI CALCULATOR:<br />Before beginning any diet it’s definitely worth checking if you actually need to lose weight as you may already be at a healthy weight and the easiest way to do this is to check your BMI at the following link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/">https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/</a><br /><br />MHRA DIET PILLS VIDEO:<br />In this video I had teamed up with The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) who regulate all medicines in the UK. Our aim in this video, was to warn people about the dangers of buying potentially life threatening diet pills from illegal online suppliers.<br /><br />Almost 2 in 3 people suffered unpleasant side effects after taking dangerous online slimming pills, these included bleeding that wouldn’t stop, heart attacks, strokes and hallucinations!<br /><br />For more information and guidance watch the video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU96dg9al4Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU96dg9al4Q</a><br /><br /><br />Want to see more videos about everything health and pharmacy?
