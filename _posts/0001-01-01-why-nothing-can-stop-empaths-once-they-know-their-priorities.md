{% raw %}Why Nothing Can Stop Empaths Once They Know Their Priorities. One major problem Empaths have is their inability to set their priorities straight and commit to them. Empaths are naturally inclined to do things for others, even if it means sacrificing their needs in the process. But what happens when Empaths choose to prioritize themselves and their goals for once? <br /><br />Empaths expend their energy on many different things aside from themselves. Imagine if they took all this and used it to fuel their own goals, ambitions, and dreams. If Empaths only do for themselves what they do for others, they will become unstoppable. Recognizing their priorities helps Empaths in every area of their lives, making it much simpler and smoother sailing. Are you an Empath who struggles with priorities?
