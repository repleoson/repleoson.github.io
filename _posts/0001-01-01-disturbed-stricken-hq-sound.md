{% raw %}The Song &quot;Stricken&quot; from the band &quot;Disturbed&quot; From the Album &quot;Ten Thousand fists&quot; Enjoy.<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />You walk on like a woman in suffering<br />Won't even bother now to tell me why<br />You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment<br />Leaving me broken another time<br />You come on like a bloodstained hurricane<br />Leave me alone, let me be this time<br />You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption<br />I don't want to mention, the reason I know<br /><br />That I am stricken and can't let you go<br />When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know<br />That I am crippled by all that you've done<br />Into the abyss will I run<br /><br />You don't know what your power has done to me<br />I want to know if I'll heal inside<br />I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen<br />Seeing you laughing another time<br />You'll never know why your face has haunted me<br />My very soul has to bleed this time<br />Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses<br />Leaving me breathless, the reason I know<br /><br />That I am stricken and can't let you go<br />When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know<br />That I am crippled by all that you've done<br />Into the abyss will I run<br /><br />Into the abyss will I run<br /><br />You walk on like a woman in suffering<br />Won't even bother now to tell me why<br />You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment<br />Leaving me broken another time<br />You come on like a bloodstained hurricane<br />Leave me alone, let me be this time<br />You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption<br />I don't want to mention, the reason I know<br /><br />That I am stricken and can't let you go<br />When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know<br />That I am crippled by all that you've done<br />Into the abyss will I run<br /><br />Into the abyss will I run<br />I can't let you go<br />Yes I am stricken and can't let you go{% endraw %}
