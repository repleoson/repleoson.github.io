{% raw %}I wanted to see if 3,000 viewers could come together in Super Mario 64 and play the game. Well, lets just say we didn't get any SM64 world records...<br /><br />merch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simply64store.com/">https://simply64store.com/</a><br />twitch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/simply">https://twitch.tv/simply</a><br />twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64">https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64</a><br />soundcloud ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/simply64">https://soundcloud.com/simply64</a><br /><br />Edited by eriksenchee &amp; oknem<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/eriksenchee">https://twitter.com/eriksenchee</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/theoknem">https://twitter.com/theoknem</a><br /><br />OUTRO SONG ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXAfgifj5u8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXAfgifj5u8</a><br /><br />Simply's chat controls a single Mario in Super Mario 64. No, they did not get the 120 Star World Record. Yes, Mizkif return stream twitch happened. What also happened in this SM64 challenge speedrun wasn't a lot. NRG speedrunning might comment on this video. Well, whats goodie. In this new Mario 64 speedrun, I don't get the mario speedrun world record (SAD!) but I do livestream this old nintendo game. I'm glad you guys enjoy the videos. It's pretty cool! Also Biggest Cheater in Super Mario 64 Speedrunning is a cool video (that got lots of views.) Okay bye guys and girls!{% endraw %}
