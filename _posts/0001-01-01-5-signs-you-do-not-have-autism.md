{% raw %}We get a lot of requests from people who want to know if their loved one has autism. Sometimes it helps to hear reasons they do not have autism. Even though we've covered similar ground in the past, when things are heard in the opposite way, the brain can form new connections and thoughts can click into place more easily. [EDIT]: There are a handful of comments mentioning that there are exceptions to this list, that autism is a spectrum. We are well aware of this, however I gave this video as a guideline (as mentioned in the video) and did not cover every case and every scenario. Such a video would be very long and could muddy the waters just as much if not more. It should be obvious by now in the autism community that autism comes in all shapes and sizes, but I will add this comment to help clarify that yes, there are exceptions to this list. As the saying goes ‚Äúyour mileage may vary.‚Äù Thanks everyone for your ongoing support and I wish you the best. üòÅ<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/autismfamily">https://www.patreon.com/autismfamily</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Autism-Family-Youtube-107318891102628?view_public_for=107318891102628">https://www.facebook.com/Autism-Family-Youtube-107318891102628?view_public_for=107318891102628</a>{% endraw %}
