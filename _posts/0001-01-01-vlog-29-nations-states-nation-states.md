{% raw %}In which the Nerdwriter brackets a sad subject with animal crackers. Special thanks to James Sheehan. One course down!<br /><br />NOTE: in trying to find a use for all the arms of the social media me, I've decided that each should serve a different purpose -- if you have questions, ask me on the Nerdwriter facebook page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://on.fb.me/tgicvo.">http://on.fb.me/tgicvo.</a> For scripts of these vlogs, and perhaps original content, check the Tumblring Nerdwriter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thenerdwriter.tumblr.com/">http://thenerdwriter.tumblr.com/</a> Otherwise, check back here for videos every Wednesday. I also have a twitter. It's good for nothing, but follow me anyway: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/vZcu9m">http://bit.ly/vZcu9m</a>{% endraw %}
