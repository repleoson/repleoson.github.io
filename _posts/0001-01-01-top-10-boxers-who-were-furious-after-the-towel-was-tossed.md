{% raw %}After what happened in the fight this past weekend I came up with the idea of ​​making a list where the boxers got angry after their corner stopped the fight by throwing in the towel. I really thought I was going to find more, but I could only find five although I imagine there are many more, and they are just not on YouTube or I could not find them for some other reason. Let me know in the comments of some other occasions, because I would like to make another video because I love watching these events.<br /><br />Like all warriors, these boxers wanted to keep fighting and didn't want to lose in a way that they consider humiliating. The only problem is that these fighters are too brave and are not going to give up even if they are losing clearly as is the case of Corrales, Brook, and Wilder. After they see the fight, they will probably be able to understand why their corner threw in the towel, because they were getting beaten up and did not need to receive so much damage from a fight that they could no longer win.<br /><br />FOR SPANISH VERSION: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/3DLJPllHrfw">https://youtu.be/3DLJPllHrfw</a><br /><br />SPANISH CHANNEL:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI9d6D3pMPQxnxZoflL5W4Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI9d6D3pMPQxnxZoflL5W4Q</a><br /><br />Thank for watching<br /><br />MUSIC:<br />Freedom Trail Studio - A Valley Blast<br /><br />AFFILIATE LINKS:<br /><br />EQUIPMENT USED:<br />1.
