{% raw %}Our democracy and economy depend on the strength of our education system.  We must ensure that our public schools have the resources needed to make public schools, schools of choice.   Jayne Ellspermann has focused her career in education on helping others exceed their own perceived potential. Her innovative practices and resulting successes earned her both state and national recognition and in 2015 she was named National Principal of the Year by NASSP.  She works with schools and school districts throughout the country to create positive learning environments, push past barriers, and empower learners by focusing on leadership development for students, teachers, and administrators. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
