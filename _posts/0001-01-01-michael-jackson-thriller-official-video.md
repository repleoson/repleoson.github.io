The &quot;Thriller&quot; single reached No. 1 in four countries in 1984, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart as well as charts in Spain, France and Belgium. The song peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, making Thriller the first album to feature seven Top 10 singles. The Recording Industry Association of America certified &quot;Thriller&quot; Gold and Platinum on December 4, 1989. <br /><br />The groundbreaking short films for the Thriller album, starting with &quot;Billie Jean,&quot; following up with &quot;Beat It&quot; and culminating with the epic, nearly 14-minute &quot;Thriller,&quot; truly expanded the possibilities of &quot;music video&quot; as art form. &quot;I wanted something that would glue you to the set, something you'd want to watch over and over,&quot; Michael wrote in his 1988 memoir Moonwalk. &quot;I wanted to be a pioneer in this relatively new medium and make the best short music movies we could make.&quot;<br /><br />In the short film's extended prologue, Michael's moonlit date with his girlfriend (played by model Ola Ray) is interrupted by his sudden transformation into a howling werewolf. While the &quot;real&quot; Michael and Ola, observing the scene in a movie theater, walk home from the their date, Michael teases her by singing the verses of &quot;Thriller.&quot;<br /><br />Subscribe to the official Michael Jackson YouTube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/subscribeYD">https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/subscribeYD</a><br /><br />Follow Michael Jackson:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/followFI">https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/followFI</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/followTI">https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/followTI</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/followII">https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/followII</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/followWI">https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/followWI</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/followSI">https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/followSI</a><br /><br />Lyrics:<br />It's close to midnight<br />Something evil's lurking from the dark<br />Under the moonlight<br />You see a sight that almost stops your heart<br />You try to scream<br />But terror takes the sound before you make it<br />You start to freeze<br />As horror looks you right between your eyes<br />You're paralyzed<br />'Cause this is thriller<br />Thriller night<br />And no one's gonna save you<br />From the beast about to strike<br />You know it's thriller<br />Thriller night<br />You're fighting for your life<br />Inside a killer thriller tonight, yeah<br /><br />#MichaelJackson #Thriller #Halloween{% endraw %}
