A Plague Tale: Innocence will be released for the PC (Windows), PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on the 14th of May 2019.<br /><br />A Plague Tale: Innocence follows the story of two siblings, Amicia and her younger brother Hugo, fighting to survive during the first phase of the Hundred Years' War.<br /><br />The game is a series of survival puzzles, mostly consisting of methods to scare away or distract the hordes of hungry rats, or direct them towards murderous knights. The main method of scaring rats off is fire, as rats will seldom enter within a radius of burning torches and braziers. The player controls Amicia, a sling-thrower who can throw rocks to break drawbridge chains or stun guards long enough for the rats to ambush them. She can also craft special ammunition and supplies, which include fire-starting sulfur stones that ignite braziers. The younger brother can be directed towards specific tasks when Amicia is busy.{% endraw %}
