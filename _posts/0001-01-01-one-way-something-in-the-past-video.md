{% raw %}The Super 70's r/b group ONE WAY. They had a plethora of hit's yet THIS one was most certainly my top favorite. Straight out right Soul music. Enjoy family. Also, Thank you for your mind and your time. Peace and Love..<br /><br />Sincerely;<br /><br />Anthony ''Seven'' Muhammad{% endraw %}
