{% raw %}When a baby is born more than three weeks earlier than the expected delivery date, the baby is referred to as ‘premature’ or “preemie”. Premature babies are often at high nutritional risk due to their increased needs for growth, reduced nutrient stores, feeding difficulties and underlying medical conditions. The Speech Therapist and Dietician can assess your baby’s feeding skills and nutrition and advise appropriately. Nurses will be available to advise and support you while you breastfeed. Your baby will be on a milk-only diet till 4-6 months corrected age, when he/she may be ready for weaning.{% endraw %}
