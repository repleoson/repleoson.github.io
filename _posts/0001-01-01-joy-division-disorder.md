{% raw %}Artist: Joy Division<br /><br />Song: Disorder<br /><br />Album: Unknown Pleasures<br /><br /><br /><br />Lyrics<br /><br /><br /><br />I've been waiting for a guide to come<br /><br />and take me by the hand<br /><br />Could these sensations make me feel<br /><br />the pleasures of a normal man<br /><br />New sensations bear the innocence -<br /><br />leave them for another day<br /><br />I've go the spirit, lose the feeling<br /><br />take the shock away<br /><br /><br /><br />It's getting faster, moving faster now,<br /><br />it's getting out of hand<br /><br />On the tenth floor, down the backstairs<br /><br />into no-man's land<br /><br />Lights are flashing,<br /><br />cars are crashing,<br /><br />getting frequent now<br /><br />I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, let it<br /><br />out somehow<br /><br /><br /><br />What means to you,<br /><br />what means to me -<br /><br />and we will meet again<br /><br />I'm watching you, I watch it all<br /><br />I take no pity from friends<br /><br />Who is right and who can tell,<br /><br />and who gives a damn right now<br /><br />Until the spirit, new sensation<br /><br />takes hold - then you know (3)<br /><br />I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling (2)<br /><br />Feeling (7){% endraw %}
