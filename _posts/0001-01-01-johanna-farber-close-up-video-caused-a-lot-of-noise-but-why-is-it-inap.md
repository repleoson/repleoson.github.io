{% raw %}So if you heard about climber's Johanna Farber inappropriate close up video on World Championship and you think that probably it's a footage of her from weird angle or something, then you really should watch this video to find out what's going here! Write in the comments if you saw some other kind of Farber's video that will make sense of all this fuss related to pretty normal clip of sport perfomance!{% endraw %}
