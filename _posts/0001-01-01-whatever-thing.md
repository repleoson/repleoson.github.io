{% raw %}Whatever thing that I have carried in this place<br />That will keep me from You, I will lay it at Your feet<br />Whatever burden I have carried for so long<br />That will keep me from seeing You, I will lay it down right now<br /><br />I need...to hear You speak to me<br />I want...to feel You in this place<br />You long...to take me in Your arms of love<br />So take me in Your arms of love<br /><br />All of the things that are cluttering my mind<br />I will push them far from here and listen for Your voice<br />All of the pain that I am carrying inside<br />I will hand it to You, You will take it set me free<br />I will fly{% endraw %}
