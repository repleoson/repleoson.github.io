{% raw %}TRAVEL IDEAS YOU WILL LOVE<br /><br />I bet you haven’t known how many handy crafts you can make using disposable gloves. Stop doing everything and watch this video!<br />Are you preparing for traveling? You will love the ideas on how to pack your suitcase and save a lot of space. Forget about big shampoo bottles and pack shampoos and liquid soap into the balloon. Also, you can store toothpaste in a balloon. If there are no balloons at home, you can replace it with disposable gloves. <br />The most popular method of making touchscreen gloves sensitive while it’s cold is to use metallic thread. Make a few stitches!<br />You may start from a handmade soap that looks so cool hand-shaped soap. You will need soap base, coloring, disposable glove, and suction cup. Start from melting soap, add any coloring you like and properly stir. Take a vase and place a glove into it upside down. It should hang inside. Pour soap base inside, attach a suction cup as it’s shown in the video and wait until it cools down. Remove the glove.<br />I love outdoor parties and this video is full of cool ideas!  Check out how to decorate a party and serve snacks. Use plastic cups to serve different snacks and appetizers like veggies, chips, nachos. You can easily make cold coffee.  Freeze coffee in ice cube silicone mold. Put coffee cubes into a glass and pour milk. Ready! It’s a perfect idea when it’s too hot outside. Cool party idea is to freeze balloons with water as a substitute for ice and keep your party drinks cold for the whole evening. <br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />00:01 Brilliant packing hacks<br />00:52 DIY Hand-shaped soap<br />01:46 Use balloons to pack beauty products<br />09:09 Cool hacks for outdoor party<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Our Social Media:<br /><br /> <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/5min.crafts/">https://www.facebook.com/5min.crafts/</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/5.min.crafts/">https://www.instagram.com/5.min.crafts/</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/5m_crafts">https://twitter.com/5m_crafts</a><br /><br /> <br /><br />Subscribe to 5-Minute Crafts GIRLY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/fWbJqz">https://goo.gl/fWbJqz</a><br /><br />Subscribe to 5-Minute Crafts KIDS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/PEuLVt">https://goo.gl/PEuLVt</a><br /><br />Subscribe to 5-Minute Crafts MEN: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2S69VUG">http://bit.ly/2S69VUG</a><br /><br /> <br /><br />The Bright Side of Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /> <br /><br />For more videos and articles visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me">http://www.brightside.me</a><br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a> This video is made for entertainment purposes.
