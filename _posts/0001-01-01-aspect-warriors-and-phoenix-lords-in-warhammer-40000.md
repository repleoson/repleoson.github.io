{% raw %}ASPECT WARRIORS AND PHOENIX LORDS IN WARHAMMER 40000<br />The Craftworld Eldar elite warriors.  They are eldar who have given themselves to the path of Khaela Mensha Khaine, their Bloody Handed God of Murder and War.  There are many forms of Aspects and each has individual style or purpose in an army.  Each is drawn from the example and teachings of one of the Phoenix lords, heroic figures who emerged to lead the Eldar during the period directly after the fall.  <br /><br />Entry quotes from 8th Edition Codex Craftworld Eldar.  <br />Covers, Asurmen and Dire Avengers, Baharroth and Swooping Hawks, Jain Zarr and Banshees, Fuegan and Fire Dragons, Kharadras and Striking Scorpions, and Muargen Ra and Dark Reapers.

Should this video be more successful and there be a real appetite for Craftworld Eldar videos then I will be more willing to create characters and stories for them.  Alas, I am a huge eldar fan and it would simply be too disappointing if I spent a lot of time and real heart making up tales that were then not heard on the channel.  There is only so much time in the day and only so much creativity for anyone.  So I hope that this simple read whets the pallet and that more eldar videos are requested.  Because it would be like a dream come true.  Lets see shall we? :){% endraw %}
