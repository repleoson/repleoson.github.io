{% raw %}When It comes to our mental health there are no gimmicks to make us feel better. I wrote this piece in the most truthful way I could bear because I think when the subject is that sensitive honesty helps. The theme is dark because my thoughts were dark but I'm responsible for the way I frame my thoughts on this channel. I hope you explore the darkness in this piece only as a contrast to the light that exists, and I hope you find the courage to embrace the optimism within. <br /><br />Forever Humbled,<br />A kid with a camera<br /><br />ðŸ”°Support me on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/illneas">https://www.patreon.com/illneas</a><br /><br />ðŸ”°Find me here ðŸ”—<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/_illneas/">https://www.instagram.com/_illneas/</a><br />                            ðŸ”—<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/illneas/">https://www.facebook.com/illneas/</a><br />                            ðŸ”—<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/illneas">https://twitter.com/illneas</a><br /><br />Second channel<br />ðŸ”—<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3urbsMSDr9XmgtnFdWZe_Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3urbsMSDr9XmgtnFdWZe_Q</a><br /><br />ðŸ”°Communities <br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/kfxthmS3F4">https://discord.gg/kfxthmS3F4</a><br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2314655172176122/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2314655172176122/</a><br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchingformeaning/">https://www.reddit.com/r/searchingformeaning/</a><br /><br />ðŸ”°References <br /><br />-The narrator is Tyler<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.artstation.com/sunshine-tm">https://www.artstation.com/sunshine-tm</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Tyleross_">https://twitter.com/Tyleross_</a><br /><br />-The music is this:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/15ZGKRywr9SwYVqOeaFAMI?si=hs8uWAasSBKTgfcs0JwzdQ&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;dl_branch=1">https://open.spotify.com/track/15ZGKRywr9SwYVqOeaFAMI?si=hs8uWAasSBKTgfcs0JwzdQ&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;dl_branch=1</a><br /><br />ðŸ”°My equipment: <br />I film handheld with a Panasonic Lumix <br />G80<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2uGqmQZ">https://amzn.to/2uGqmQZ</a><br />GX80<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/33e5Tye">https://amzn.to/33e5Tye</a><br />ðŸ“·Olympus M.Zuiko Digital 45mm F1.8 Lens  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2vr9P3N">https://amzn.to/2vr9P3N</a><br /><br />ðŸ”°I'm Here Even Though I Hate Myself by illneas<br /><br />I'm lost<br />I'm imperfect <br />one person in the endless echo of the universe <br />waiting to be forgotten<br /><br />I'm insignificant  <br />I'm imperfect <br />I'm the face you ignored today <br />that your unconscious mind will use to populate a dream<br /><br />I'm not an artist<br />I'm imperfect <br />I'm gathering dust on a digital shelf<br />while fading from your mind<br /><br />I'm isolated <br />I'm imperfect<br />And if you can feel my words you might help me defeat my loneliness<br />or at least numb my emotions<br /><br />I'm still here <br />even though I hate myself<br />because the courage in my heart will always be a paradox <br /><br />I'm guarding my thin slice of paradise between old buildings<br />and the dreams that never became true<br /><br />the purpose of my life is limited by the painful beauty of my freedom<br />and exists because of it<br /><br />I'm the sum total of my mistakes <br />and If you see any beauty in that <br />it is because I found the strength to own them  <br /><br />I'm still lost <br />I'm still imperfect<br />I'm still here{% endraw %}
