{% raw %}Heart Live At The Royal Albert Hall - released 25th November 2016.<br /><br />DVD - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://smarturl.it/HEARTRAHDVD">http://smarturl.it/HEARTRAHDVD</a><br />Blu Ray - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://smarturl.it/HEARTRAHBR">http://smarturl.it/HEARTRAHBR</a><br />CD - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://smarturl.it/HEARTRAHCD">http://smarturl.it/HEARTRAHCD</a><br /><br />In a career spanning over 40 years it seems inconceivable that they have never performed at Londonâ€™s most famous venue The Royal Albert Hall. That changed in June 2016 as the band appeared with The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra adding some a classical vibe to hits like These Dreams, Alone and What about Love, they also reinvented old favourites like Dreamboat Annie and Magic Man while rocking the house to the rafters with Crazy on You and Barracuda. This very special show was most certainly not just nostalgia as the band and their extra 68 backing musicians also played tracks from their 16th album Beautiful Broken.      <br /><br />Music video by Heart, The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra performing Alone.
