{% raw %}Learn how to pronounce &quot;appropriately&quot; with the American Pronunciation Guide (&quot;APG&quot;)!<br /><br />The American Pronunciation Guide is devoted to descriptive linguistics--i.e., the study of the internal phonological, grammatical, and semantic structures of languages without reference to the history of the language or comparison with other languages.  We believe that the best way to learn how to say &quot;appropriately&quot; (or any other word) is to listen to the pronunciation of our peers.  To help foster such descriptive learning, we provide videos combining relevant clips from popular culture.
