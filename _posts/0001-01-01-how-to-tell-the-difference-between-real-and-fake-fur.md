{% raw %}Much-touted fake, or faux, fur also has no guarantee of being cruelty-free. It may even contain real fur because of non-requirement to label globally, as well as the ever-cheaper prices of Chinese real fur. As faux fur becomes more realistic-looking and real fur becomes harder to identify -- because of increased modification with dyes -- WSPA has identified a few ways in which consumers can tell the difference between the two.<br /><br />Note: This film was originally produced prior to June 2014, when we were known as the World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA). We are now World Animal Protection.{% endraw %}
