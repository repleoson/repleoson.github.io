{% raw %}Dr. Phil welcomes back previous guest Heather and her daughter, Marissa, who was rebelling in dangerous ways, like stealing her mom’s car and smoking marijuana. Since their appearance, Heather says things have gone from bad to worse. She says Marissa has continued to steal her car, smoke weed, fail at school and get into fist fights with other girls – and allegedly has also tried to kill Heather by poisoning her with hydrocodone tablets. Watch while Dr. Phil reads a chilling text exchange in which Marissa says she has already attempted to kill her mother! Marissa denies she ever tried to poison her mother and says she was just joking around in her texts.
