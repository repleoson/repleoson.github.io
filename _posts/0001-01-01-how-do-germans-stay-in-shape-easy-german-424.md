In German we use the word &quot;fit&quot; to describe a number of things related to your health. Other than in English &quot;fit&quot; is not only used to describe that you have been training. In German, &quot;fit&quot; is rather used to describe that you are healthy. You can translate the terms &quot;fit bleiben&quot; or &quot;fit halten&quot; with &quot;to stay in shape&quot; or &quot;to keep yourself healthy&quot;. You could also ask &quot;Bist du wieder fit?&quot; if you wanted to ask someone if they felt better after being sick.<br />---<br />PRODUCED BY:<br />Easy Languages is an international video project aiming at supporting people worldwide to learn languages through authentic street interviews and expose the street culture of participating partner countries abroad. Episodes are produced in local languages and contain subtitles in both the original language as well as in English.<br />---<br />Hosts of this episode: Janusz Hamerski/Carina Schmid <br />Camera &amp; Edit: Chris Thornberry<br />Translation: Ben Eve{% endraw %}
