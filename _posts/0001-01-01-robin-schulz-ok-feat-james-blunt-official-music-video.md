Robin Schulz’s new single “OK” is a beautifully melodic deep house anthem paired with James Blunt’s distinctive vocals that releases today and is already creating quite a stir.<br /> <br />The two superstars hit it off from the start and their chemistry on the track is undeniable: “I’ve had many great nights in Ibiza clubs listening to the very talented Robin Schulz DJ’ing, so this collaboration is very exciting for me,” James Blunt confirms. The feeling is mutual, as Robin Schulz adds: “I’m really looking forward to this release. What a great experience to work with a fantastic artist like James. This song is perfect for the summer!”<br /> <br />Also releasing is the brand new companion video, directed by Liza Minou Morberg and starring James Blunt alongside German actress Lisa Tomaschewsky (“Deutschland 83”), who was very much impressed by the clip’s visual aesthetic: “I was really drawn in by its cinematic approach.” The video pays homage to Michel Gondry’s movie “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” and details a young man trying to rid himself from the memories of a past relationship, before the chorus reminds us that in the end: “It’s gonna be okay!”<br /> <br />What’s more, “OK (feat. James Blunt)” gives listeners a first taste of Robin Schulz’s forthcoming new album. On September 8th the superstar DJ and record-breaking producer will release his third studio album “Uncovered” with a total of 18 new tracks. “Uncovered” is the follow-up to his Platinum-certified breakthrough debut “Prayer” (2014) and his Gold-certified sophomore LP “Sugar” (2015).<br /> <br />Less than three years in the making Robin Schulz ranks among the most sought after acts on the globe and currently holds DJ residencies at Ibiza venues Ushuaia and Pacha as well as the Wynn in Las Vegas. It all began with his record-setting remix “Prayer in C” (the internationally most successful hit of a German act to date). All in all he landed six Top 10 single releases in just under one and a half years. Late in 2016, the German ECHO award winner dropped his extraordinary David Guetta collab-single “Shed  A Light (feat. Cheat Codes)”. The track was certified Gold in Germany and Platinum in several other countries.<br /> <br />Multiple Grammy nominee and internationally acclaimed British artist James Blunt has already sold more than 20 million albums and 12.8 million singles worldwide, making him one of the most successful singers/songwriters of the current millennium. This spring he released his fifth studio album “The Afterlove”, to be followed by an extensive world tour later this year. His previous album “Moon Landing” (2013) was awarded Platinum in UK and included the stunning  #1 single “Bonfire Heart”.{% endraw %}
