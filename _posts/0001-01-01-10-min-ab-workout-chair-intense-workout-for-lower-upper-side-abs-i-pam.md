{% raw %}Looking for something new? Grab your chair ♥︎ Let’s work with ELEVATION and train our abs the expert way! / Werbung  <br /><br />WHY A CHAIR / BENCH?<br />▸ It can make some exercises EASIER. Resting our feet for crunches? Hell yes. <br />▸ But in general… it makes it HARDER :D <br />▸ Using it as an ELEVATION for our feet, which makes standard exercises like Spider Planks or Side Planks soooo much more intense. <br />▸ And it’s a beautiful HELP to keep our body stable. Hold onto your chair and 100% focus on your abs for Reverse Crunches or Lower Ab Lifts. <br /><br />TECHNIQUE:<br />▸ Side Planks: If the elevated version gets too hard, perform a normal Side Plank with your feet on the floor instead. And if that gets too hard, rest your knees on the floor &amp; only lift your hip. There are several ways to NOT take a break :D <br />▸ Planks: For elevated planks, make sure that your body is a straight line. Don’t stick your butt up in the air, don’t be a sinking ship. <br /><br />The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing 30s for each exercise. <br /><br />__<br /><br />▸ I offer FREE WORKOUT PLANS on my Instagram Channel &amp; in my Pam App. <br />30min, 45min Weights / Sweaty / Slow, Beginner Friendly, 60min Hardcore &amp; a Dance Plan.
