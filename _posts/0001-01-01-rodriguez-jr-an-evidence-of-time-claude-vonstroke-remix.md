Claude VonStroke, Audiofly and Tim Green have stepped up to produce three unique<br />adaptations that flow explicitly and reinvent the album tracks.<br />Incorporating a delectable “huh” and graceful piano, Claude VonStroke has excelled with his interpretation of<br />An Evidence of Time. Animating the original with an emphatic bassline and unyielding timbres, whilst paying<br />homage to the original with the mid-way breakdown. Audiofly have reconstructed Radian with their discernible<br />sound. Their remix strips down the original, migrating through hypnotic synthesis, steadily building then fading<br />to silence. Keeping the original kick a prominent feature, Tim Green ’s rendition of the title track Baobab shines<br />through. A hearty techno beat forms the basis of the minimalistic roller.<br />Dirtybird founder Claude VonStroke has had an incredible year with his longstanding label receiving Mixmag’s<br />Label of the Decade award back in July. Aside from touring the globe, Audiofly recently claimed they were<br />“ exactly where we want to be as djs and performers ” when the duo made their debut appearance at Burning<br />Man this year.{% endraw %}
