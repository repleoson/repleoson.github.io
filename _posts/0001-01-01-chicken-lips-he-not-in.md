The bassline is an enduring sound in dance music that everyone knows, and pretty much everyone loves. <br /><br />Eats Everything sticks close to the structure of the original, jacking the beats and bass up to maximum capacity for an explosive, peak-time houser adding energy to the vibe. Groove Armada turn in a phenomenal reworking, teasing the original bassline over heavy swung beats and sharply drawn percussion, phasing the track out of all recognition for a tensely rewarding crescendo. Noir’s Personal Edit is a version which Noir continues to play on the road since the release of the original and its inclusion will satisfy anyone who’s heard him drop this live. Mutiny take things directly to the dancefloor for an out-and-out 4/4 stomper while Stanton Warriors show us big beats are best with their trademark breakbeat take on this club classic, using their masterful ability to re-work a record whilst retaining the strength and style of the original to create this dance floor destroyer. Rounding things up is Felix Houzer’s Straight Down La Brae Remix which, with its deep bassline and rolling grooves, compliments the pack to ensure once again there will be something here for all.{% endraw %}
