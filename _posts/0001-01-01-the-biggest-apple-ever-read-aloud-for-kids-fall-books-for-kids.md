{% raw %}Book: The Biggest Apple Ever by Steve Kroll Illustrated by Jeni Bassett<br /><br />Hello and Welcome to The Joyful Bookshelf where books are FUN! This channel is dedicated helping children find JOY in books! Here you will find books read aloud for children.  I love to read aloud for kids! <br /><br />Did you know that reading books to kids improves their vocabulary and language skills? It also exercises their brain, improves concentration, encourages their imagination and it's FUN!<br /><br />There are so many wonderful children's books to share.
