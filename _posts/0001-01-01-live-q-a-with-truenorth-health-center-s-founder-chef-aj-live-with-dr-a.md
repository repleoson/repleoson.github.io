Under his guidance, the Center has become one of the premier training facilities for doctors wishing to gain certification in the supervision of therapeutic fasting.<br /><br />Dr. Goldhamer was the principal investigator in two landmark studies. The first: &quot;Medically Supervised Water-Only Fasting in the Treatment of Hypertension&quot; appeared in the June 2001 issue of the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics. Its publication marked a turning point in the evolution of evidence supporting the benefits of water-only fasting. The second study: &quot;Medically Supervised Water-Only Fasting in the Treatment of Borderline Hypertension,&quot; appeared in the October 2002 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine.<br /><br />Currently, Dr. Goldhamer is directing a team that is developing a prospective study, incorporating random assignment and long-term follow-up on the cost and clinical outcomes in the treatment of diabetes and high blood pressure with fasting and a health-promoting diet. <br /><br />After completing his chiropractic education at Western States Chiropractic College in Portland, Oregon, Dr. Goldhamer traveled to Australia, where he became licensed as an osteopathic physician. He is the author of The Health Promoting Cookbook and co-author of The Pleasure Trap: Mastering The Hidden Force That Undermines Health and Happiness.<br /><br />For coaching services:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.healthpromoting.com/clinic-services/health-services/coaching-services">https://www.healthpromoting.com/clinic-services/health-services/coaching-services</a><br /><br />To register for a stay at TrueNorth: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.healthpromoting.com/registration">https://www.healthpromoting.com/registration</a><br /><br />If you enjoyed today's Q &amp; A you might also enjoy these video of Dr. Goldhamer: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSbe-rqH-Qw&amp;t=3614s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSbe-rqH-Qw&amp;t=3614s</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQD5uIYrJg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQD5uIYrJg</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAHjQwOgpPg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAHjQwOgpPg</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AEVK0Xn6J0&amp;t=21s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AEVK0Xn6J0&amp;t=21s</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAwq-ARSC90">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAwq-ARSC90</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tRcv0rZ-lQ&amp;t=12s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tRcv0rZ-lQ&amp;t=12s</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuC_mCyqj14&amp;t=43s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuC_mCyqj14&amp;t=43s</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPF7yZq1u5c&amp;t=13s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPF7yZq1u5c&amp;t=13s</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loysdgX4srM&amp;t=72s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loysdgX4srM&amp;t=72s</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4E2oql4ZVM&amp;t=7s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4E2oql4ZVM&amp;t=7s</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />TIME CODE:<br />00:00 Guest introduction and TrueNorth guest week recap<br />0:04:45 Viewer and Chef AJ Q &amp; A for Dr. Goldhamer<br />1:20:15 Final thoughts and important message from Dr. Goldhamer{% endraw %}
