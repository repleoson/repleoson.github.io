{% raw %}It's (FINALLY!) here: a 7am-10pm day in my life as a corporate lawyer working from the OFFICE in Canary Wharf (London). I am now almost halfway through my training contract at Clifford Chance, currently working in the M&amp;A (mergers and acquisitions) team. In this video, I share my morning routine, the kind of work I do during the day and a sneak-peak of an upcoming office tour video that I'm making with a couple of other trainees üòÉ<br /><br />If you've ever wondered what it's really like to be a trainee lawyer at a top corporate law firm, this hopefully gives you an insight into the hours, the work lawyers actually do and the perks of working for a firm that really cares for its people!<br /><br />So yeh - enjoy, and please do let me know what you think in the comments ü§ó  <br />‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.<br /><br />üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Download my LPC and GDL notes (in PDF format) for free... or get the premium notes for word document versions! üòÄ<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://liamporritt.com/law-notes">https://liamporritt.com/law-notes</a><br /><br />......................................................<br /><br />My Free Trello Masterclass<br /><br />'More Focus, Less Stress - Build Your Ultimate Productivity System in Trello' is my FREE course (Trello is also FREE), which you can take by signing up for a free 2-week SkillShare trial: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://skl.sh/3h2XpV1">https://skl.sh/3h2XpV1</a><br /><br />... The course walks you through how to build your customised version of my insanely powerful (but simple) Trello productivity system (aka the app that keeps me focused for 10 hours per day!) üì±<br /><br />‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.<br /><br />About Me<br /><br />I'm a trainee lawyer, part-time YouTuber, son, brother, startup founder, boyfriend, black coffee drinker and plant dad. I graduated from Cambridge University (where I studied French and Spanish), topped my law school class and now work for a corporate law firm in London as a trainee solicitor (which takes up a lot of my time)!<br /><br />Around that, I'm a big fan of discovering new ways of thinking, of balancing work with life, and of performing to the very best of my ability. Ohh, and being happy. And I try to share all that on this YouTube channel üòÄ<br /><br />Fun fact: I believe we massively overplay the role of ‚Äúnatural talent‚Äù üòÆ AND‚Ä¶ I also believe that TOGETHER, WE ARE ALL CAPABLE OF POSITIVITY, PRODUCTIVITY AND SUCCESS.<br /><br />üì∏  Instagram ‚Äì <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/liam.porritt/">https://www.instagram.com/liam.porritt/</a><br />üåç  My little kingdom ‚Äì <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://liamporritt.com">https://liamporritt.com</a>{% endraw %}
