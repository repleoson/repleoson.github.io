{% raw %}Can you believe that I've only ever made one bridal shower set? And I've never made a wedding set (although I did make cookie place cards for the wedding attached to this set). This set I made a couple years ago for a dear childhood friend's bridal shower. The shower was in the summer, but the wedding was in the fall in a barn in the Northeast so of course I had to do a fall theme for the set! <br /><br />Techniques covered in this video: <br />- 2 consistency outline and flood <br />- using a projector <br />- lettering <br />- fan brush painting <br />- using luster dust <br />- detail piping<br />- pressure piped detail piping <br />- wood grain technique <br /><br />----<br />Products for this set: <br /><br />Cookie cutters: <br />- Mrs plaque cutter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kaleidacuts.com/products/nancy-plaque-cookie-cutter?_pos=6&amp;_sid=a9d99cdac&amp;_ss=r">https://www.kaleidacuts.com/products/nancy-plaque-cookie-cutter?_pos=6&amp;_sid=a9d99cdac&amp;_ss=r</a><br />- Miss to Mrs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kaleidacuts.com/products/miss-to-mrs-cookie-cutter?_pos=2&amp;_sid=4b732eb1b&amp;_ss=r">https://www.kaleidacuts.com/products/miss-to-mrs-cookie-cutter?_pos=2&amp;_sid=4b732eb1b&amp;_ss=r</a> <br />- Scalloped heart: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kaleidacuts.com/products/funky-scalloped-heart-cookie-cutter?_pos=2&amp;_sid=21d91d57c&amp;_ss=r">https://www.kaleidacuts.com/products/funky-scalloped-heart-cookie-cutter?_pos=2&amp;_sid=21d91d57c&amp;_ss=r</a><br />- Maple leaf: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://brightoncutters.com/products/geometric-maple-leaf?_pos=1&amp;_sid=08a046f40&amp;_ss=r">https://brightoncutters.com/products/geometric-maple-leaf?_pos=1&amp;_sid=08a046f40&amp;_ss=r</a><br />- Ring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/39heBB9">https://amzn.to/39heBB9</a> (affiliate link)<br />- Wheat plaque: unknown <br />- Mason jar: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3CqPZ5u">https://amzn.to/3CqPZ5u</a> (affiliate link)<br /><br />Gold highlighter/luster dust: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://trulymadplastics.com/TMP-Super-GOLD-p76477425">https://trulymadplastics.com/TMP-Super-GOLD-p76477425</a><br /><br />Edible alternative for the gold: The Sugar Art Sterling Pearl in Wedding Gold (or Super Gold!): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3xR9EJb">https://bit.ly/3xR9EJb</a><br />*** use code THEGRACEFULBAKER15 for 15% off your order from The Sugar Art!<br /><br />Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.purple-planet.com">https://www.purple-planet.com</a> &quot;Love of my Life&quot; <br /><br />-----<br /><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/the.graceful.baker">https://www.instagram.com/the.graceful.baker</a><br /><br />Amazon shop of my favorite things: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/the.graceful.baker">https://www.amazon.com/shop/the.graceful.baker</a><br />*I do receive a small commission from items purchased from my shop.

I still use a lot of gel colors though! <br /><br />Tipless bags: Borderlands Bakery - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://borderlandsbakery.com/product-page/tipless-piping-bags-s-or-m-100-pcs/">https://borderlandsbakery.com/product-page/tipless-piping-bags-s-or-m-100-pcs/</a><br /><br />Dehydrator: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/38mYL75">https://amzn.to/38mYL75</a> (affiliate link)<br /><br />Scribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/30zTkPd">https://amzn.to/30zTkPd</a> (affiliate link){% endraw %}
