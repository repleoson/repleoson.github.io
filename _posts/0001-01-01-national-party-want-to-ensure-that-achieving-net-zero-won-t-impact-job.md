{% raw %}Resources and Water Minister Keith Pitt says he wants to ensure achieving net-zero in Australia “doesn’t impact jobs in regional areas”.  <br /><br />It comes as Prime Minister Scott Morrison is set to devise a revised climate change policy for Australia to achieve net-zero emission by 2050 but he will need the National Party’s agreement.  <br /><br />“We need to see the proposal, potential cost, who’s paying, as I’ve said many times - it won’t be the people of regional Australia,” Mr Pitt told Sky News host Chris Kenny.  <br /><br />“In terms of the impact, well we want to ensure that ... it doesn’t impact jobs in regional areas. <br /><br />“Those jobs do rely on the resources sector, on agriculture, and all things that go with them.”{% endraw %}
