{% raw %}I've seen a lotta creative foil surf stunts before, but this one may just be the coolest and most original ones I've ever witnessed! Andy Finch is not only an Olympic Snowboard Athlete who competed alongside Shaun <br /><br /><br />White, but was also one of the finalists on The Amazing Race Season 19. In the winter you can find him on the mountains and back country of Tahoe dropping massive cliffs and stylish powder turns. He then spends his summers coaching wakesurfing and foiling on Lake Tahoe and he's super comfortable on anything he rides. You've seen him before in some of my Can You Ride It videos and we love hangin together on and off the water. When he spotted this tiny slot between the land and this massive rock, his wheels started turning. He saw the challenge and was up for it whether he had a fail or successful run. Do you think he made it? Comment below. Thanks for watching! Enjoy your ride! ✌️ <br /><br />MURRCH!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shaun-murray.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage">https://shaun-murray.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage</a><br />----------------------------------------------<br />➜ LEARN MORE ABOUT SHAUN AT<br />--------------<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shaunmurray.com">https://shaunmurray.com</a> <br /><br />----------------------------------------------- <br />➜ CONNECT WITH ME <br />--------<br />Facebook- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/ShaunMurrayWake">https://facebook.com/ShaunMurrayWake</a> <br />Instagram- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/shaunmurray">https://instagram.com/shaunmurray</a> <br /><br />---------------------------------------------- <br />➜ ENJOYING MY RIDE <br />--------<br />STANDING ON- Hyperlite Murray 139 &amp; 144 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hyperlite.com/en/product/wakeboards-murray">https://hyperlite.com/en/product/wakeboards-murray</a> <br />FEET IN- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hyperlite.com/en/product/wakeboard-boots-team-x">https://hyperlite.com/en/product/wakeboard-boots-team-x</a> <br />HOLDING- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hyperlite.com/en/product/wakeboard-ropes-handles-murray-t">https://www.hyperlite.com/en/product/wakeboard-ropes-handles-murray-t</a> <br />--------<br />FIND YOUR LOCAL HYPERLITE DEALER- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hyperlite.com/en/dealerLocator">https://www.hyperlite.com/en/dealerLocator</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------- <br />➜ ALWAYS WEARING <br />--------<br />Jetpilot Signature Vest (CGA Approved)- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jetpilot.com/collections/signature-series-vests/products/shaun-murray-neoprene-cga-vest-1">https://jetpilot.com/collections/signature-series-vests/products/shaun-murray-neoprene-cga-vest-1</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------- <br />➜ BOAT OF CHOICE <br />--------<br />Nautique G23 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nautique.com">https://nautique.com</a> <br />Speed- 23mph Length- 75ft<br /><br />---------------------------------------------- <br />➜ MY PROGRESSION SECRET WEAPON <br />--------<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bbtalkinusa.com/product/shaun-murray-coaching-package/">https://www.bbtalkinusa.com/product/shaun-murray-coaching-package/</a> <br /><br />----------------------------------------------- <br />➜ DIALING MY WAKE WITH <br />--------<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://leadwake.com">https://leadwake.com</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------- <br />➜ GET MY GEAR FROM THE ORIGINAL WAKE SHOP <br />--------<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://perfski.com">https://perfski.com</a><br /><br />-----------------------------------------------<br />➜ DRIVING THE BEST WITH <br />--------<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://mausfamilyautomotive.com">http://mausfamilyautomotive.com</a>{% endraw %}
