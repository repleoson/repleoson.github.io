Putting aside self-centred doubt and ungratefulness we come to understand that the Here and Now is the doorway between the limited and the Infinite, between time and Eternity. To pass through this doorway is ‘To find the key to all existence.’<br /><br /><br />CREDITS<br /><br />Music by Sami Yusuf<br />Words by Seyyed Hossein Nasr<br /><br /><br />LYRICS<br /><br />Why am I in this place torn asunder by blight?<br />Shorn by the blades of inequity, drowned by darkness,<br />Immersed in the turbid waters of negligence and forgetfulness?<br />Question not why, but understand this simple truth:<br />Here is the Centre that is the Centre of all wheres,<br />Now is the moment at the heart of all times.<br />Ask not why here and now<br /><br />But be in the here and now<br />Here is the Centre that is the Centre of all wheres,<br />Now is the moment at the heart of all times<br />Ask not why here and now<br /><br />But be in the here and now<br />To find the key to all existence<br /><br /><br />#SYTheCentre #SamiYusuf <br /><br />(C) Andante Records.
