{% raw %}Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell talked about &quot;gradual&quot; tapering while downplaying China's Evergrande contagion concerns on the U.S. market.<br /><br />When clarifying the Fed's stance, Powell indicated that it would be a &quot;very gradual taper,&quot; which could conclude in the middle of next year.<br /><br />The Fed Chair was also asked about China's Evergrande debt issue, which sparked a rout in the markets earlier this week.<br /><br />&quot;The Evergrande situation seems very particular to China, which has very high debt for an emerging economy,&quot; Powell told reporters. &quot;Corporate defaults in the U.S. are very low right now … You would worry that it would affect global financial conditions through confidence channels.”<br />__________________________________________________________________<br />Kitco News is the world’s #1 source of metals market information.
