This is Jack from tofluency.com and in this English lesson, we're going to look at the phrase 'excited about going' because this is one example of when we use an adjective with a preposition and then the gerund. Don't worry too much about those terms because we're going to have a look at  lots of examples.<br /><br />So firstly, let's break this down... so, we use excited with to be, then we have the adjective excited, then we have the preposition about, and then we either have the noun or the gerund. In this case, I've put doing. So, to be excited about doing something, as I said before, this is when we're using a specific preposition with an adjective. Let's look at some examples now.<br /><br />Before these kids went swimming, you can say: they're excited about going swimming tomorrow. They are excited about going. Here is an example using the present perfect: he's been excited about the World Cup for a long time. He's been excited about the World Cup for a long time. In this case, we're not using the gerund. We're just using the noun the World Cup. Now for an example in the negative: they don't seem very excited about camping. They don't seem very excited about camping.<br /><br />Now here is a quote that I think you'll like: &quot;Stop worrying about what can go wrong and get excited about what can go right.&quot; Now, my question for you is this: what are you excited about doing? What are you excited about doing? So, think about something that's going to happen soon and tell me what you are excited about doing. Thank you for watching this video.
