{% raw %}A large number of Afghan special forces join the Taliban in Panjshir\<br /><br />The Taliban have retrained a large number of Afghan Security Agency agents and Afghan special forces members who surrendered. These people will soon be driven to the front line of the Panjshir Valley. This is to trade the title. After being brave in the battle, they will be their own people. If they are greedy for life and fear of death, they will be punished! Therefore, these people are undoubtedly going to take the lead.<br /><br />Thousands of resistance forces now in the Panjshir Valley were members of the Afghan Special Forces and soldiers of the Afghan National Army in the past. This is the best name for the Afghan army that surrendered to the Taliban to enter the valley and eliminate these former comrades in arms.{% endraw %}
