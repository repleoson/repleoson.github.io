Our scenic designer, Eric Ponpetenieff, totally captured the vision of “WILD” and created something incredible with live trees, ferns, moss, and flowers. He turned the stage in to a lush living garden, he even brought in a eucalyptus tree from his own property! Needless to say, it smelled AMAZING in the theatre that night.” -Kim Walker-Smith<br /><br />Join Kim on:    <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kimwalkersmith/">https://www.instagram.com/kimwalkersmith/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/kimwalkersmithmusic/">https://www.facebook.com/kimwalkersmithmusic/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/kimwalkersmith">https://twitter.com/kimwalkersmith</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bravesurrenderbook.com/book.html">http://bravesurrenderbook.com/book.html</a> <br /><br />LYRICS<br />Jesus Christ<br />King of all<br />Everything at Your name<br />Has to fall<br /><br />Darkness runs<br />At the sound<br />Everything at Your name<br />Has to bow<br /><br />Peace has overcome my heart<br />So worry never can<br />Hope has taken back that space<br />Disappointment had<br /><br />I believe Your promises<br />Above my circumstance<br />Fear could never conquer me<br />Cause You already have<br /><br />All the way through the night<br />You’ve got armies of angels<br />Assigned to my life<br />I’ve got nothing to fear<br /><br />I surrender the fight<br />To the one who is greater<br />Right here by my side<br />I’ve got nothing to fear{% endraw %}
