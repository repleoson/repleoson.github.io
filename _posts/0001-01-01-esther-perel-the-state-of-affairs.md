They offer a window into our personal and cultural attitudes about love, lust, and commitment. Infidelity is considered one of the most traumatic events that can befall a couple, yet this all too common experience is poorly understood. Using real-life stories pulled from couples visiting her therapy practice over the past decade, Esther implores her readers to engage in a new conversation about the topic, in the hope of gaining a better understanding of the meaning of trust and fidelity.<br /><br />Psychotherapist Esther Perel is recognized as one of today’s most insightful and original voices on modern relationships. Fluent in nine languages, she holds a therapy practice in New York City and serves as an organizational consultant for Fortune 500 companies around the world. Her celebrated TED talks have garnered more than 18 million views and her bestseller “Mating in Captivity: Unlocking Erotic Intelligence” became a global phenomenon translated into 24 languages.<br /><br />Esther appears in conversation with New York Times reporter Patricia Cohen, whose most recent book is “In Our Prime: The Invention of Middle Age.”<br /><br />Recorded October 11, 2017{% endraw %}
