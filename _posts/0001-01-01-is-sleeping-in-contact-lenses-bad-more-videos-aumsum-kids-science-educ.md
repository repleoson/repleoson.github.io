They even trap bacteria. So, wearing them for too long, failing to clean them periodically and sleeping in them can cause excessive dryness and even eye infection.<br /><br />In addition to this, unlike other parts of our body, the cornea of our eye receives oxygen from the surrounding air and not from blood vessels.<br /><br />Now, when we wear contact lenses during the day, it reduces the oxygen supply to the cornea. But when we wear them while sleeping also, it further reduces the oxygen supply to the cornea. Hence, to satisfy the oxygen need, tiny blood vessels grow in the cornea, thus causing blurred vision.{% endraw %}
