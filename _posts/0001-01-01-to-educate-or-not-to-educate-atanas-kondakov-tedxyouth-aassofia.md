{% raw %}Imagine you are in 7th grade and you have a test that is going to determine your academic future. That's the reality for many students, especially here in Bulgaria. Having experienced three different educational systems, Nasko decided that if all of them are combined, a new educational standard can be formed and used in local Bulgarian schools.<br /><br />Atanas, called Nasko by all his friends and family, was born in the coastal city of Burgas. After spending 6 months with his mother and grandma, Nasko moved to Sofia. He has lived there since then. With both his parents working hard to ensure he has a great life and future, he was lucky enough to receive a great education as well. His primary school (I-III grade) was the 34th public school &quot;Stoyu Shishkov&quot;. Nasko then went to &quot;Doris Tenedi&quot;, a private school with foreign languages, where he studied Spanish (IV-VII grade). After that, with months of hard work, he won a full scholarship at the Anglo-American School of Sofia (VIII grade - present). Having experienced three different educational systems, Nasko decided that if all of them are combined, a new educational standard can be formed and used in Bulgarian schools.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
