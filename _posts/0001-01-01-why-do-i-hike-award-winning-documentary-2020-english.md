{% raw %}Hi, my name is Nikola Horvat - Tesla and I present to you my first solo documentary. <br /><br />In summer of 2019. I went to hike Colorado Trail to find the reasons why do I hike. This was independent project and the movie was filmed, edited and written by myself. It was challenging to carry all of video equipment in my backpack, but I had a vision and a goal - I wanted to capture my inner reasons why I do hike and why do I always go back to long distance hiking. <br /><br />Why do I hike won 3 grand prix awards and it was once a finalist and official selection on various film festivals.<br /><br />Please consider to subscribe and do share this movie :) THANK YOU<br /><br />Follow me on social media:<br />www.nikolahorvat.com<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/nikolahorvat1pct">https://www.facebook.com/nikolahorvat1pct</a><br />Instagram: nikolahorvat_tesla<br /><br />Check out my PCT documentary &quot;PCT, Year of the beginning&quot; here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/OwAT_6H6PWA">https://youtu.be/OwAT_6H6PWA</a> <br /><br />my Grand Canyon adventure here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/VP4GfsWsCMQ">https://youtu.be/VP4GfsWsCMQ</a><br /><br />hiking in Bosnia here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/YuZl2Io3D9U">https://youtu.be/YuZl2Io3D9U</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/IReDrSRGO1g">https://youtu.be/IReDrSRGO1g</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/fKxvzutc2m8">https://youtu.be/fKxvzutc2m8</a><br /><br />One more thing!
