{% raw %}an absolute MOOD BOOSTER ♥︎ Feeling lazy? Unmotivated? A bit sad? Or just looking for a FUN Cardio session? / Werbung<br /><br />Welcome to the ENERGY BOOST workout. First song, second move &amp; I am already smiling from ear to ear :))) I would say the style is a mix between: <br />- 12min Happy Sweat <br />- 15min Happy Dance<br />- 15min Boxing Cardio <br /><br />The music is super cool &amp; it's definitely an intense and sweaty Dance Cardio Routine - but for some reason I have more energy afterwards than before :D Plus, you don't notice that you did a hundred squats during those 10min. I know - sneaky. <br /><br />The moves are more &quot;classic&quot; than the ones of a dance workout, easier to follow &amp; definitely more high energy from start till finish. I hope you like it!  <br />__<br /><br />Apart form the good mood &amp; I can also guarantee a serious number of burned calories here. <br /><br />▸ I burned 70kcal in those 10min.<br />Depending on your height, weight and fitness level this might vary between 70-150kcal. <br /><br />__<br /><br />▸  my Pam App ♥︎ Free workout plans, recipes &amp; tips: <br />➞ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pam-app.de/app">https://www.pam-app.de/app</a><br /><br />▸ you can find FREE WORKOUT PLANS on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations.
