However, you can still support me if you enjoy the content by donating a one off payment via my BuyMeaCoffee. Every donation is really appreciated, releasing these videos on a regular schedule doesn't come natural to me and I like to know that you appreciate them. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/SenpaiTorpidDow">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/SenpaiTorpidDow</a><br /><br />Elite Mod Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dawnofwar.info/">https://www.dawnofwar.info/</a><br /><br />If you are interested in joining the community for the elite mod and getting into the game after having not played for a while or never even at all feel free to join us in the official elite mod discord and introduce yourself there.
