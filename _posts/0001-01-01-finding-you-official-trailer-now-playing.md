{% raw %}FINDING YOU is an inspirational romantic drama full of heart and humor about finding the strength to be true to oneself.  After an ill-fated audition at a prestigious New York music conservatory, violinist Finley Sinclair (Rose Reid) travels to an Irish coastal village to begin her semester studying abroad. At the B&amp;B run by her host family she encounters gregarious and persistent heartthrob movie star Beckett Rush (Jedidiah Goodacre), who is there to film another installment of his medieval fantasy-adventure franchise. As romance sparks between the unlikely pair, Beckett ignites a journey of discovery for Finley that transforms her heart, her music, and her outlook on life. In turn, Finley emboldens Beckett to reach beyond his teen-idol image and pursue his true passion.  But when forces surrounding Beckett’s stardom threaten to crush their dreams, Finley must decide what she is willing to risk for love.<br /><br />Written and directed by Brian Baugh, the film also stars Katherine McNamara, Patrick Bergin, Saoirse-Monica Jackson, and Judith Hoag, with Tom Everett Scott and Academy Award® winner Vanessa Redgrave. It was shot exclusively in Ireland, in and around Dublin, Claire, Offaly and Kildare.  The film’s “village set” location was in the beautiful town of Carlingford.{% endraw %}
