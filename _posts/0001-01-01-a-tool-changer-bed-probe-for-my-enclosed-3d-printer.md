{% raw %}I needed a robust solution for a bed probe inside my heated chamber 3D printer. That's why I made a clicky switch bed probe that gets picked up by the hotend for probing then parked when not in use. Thanks to &quot;mr. awesome&quot; for providing the prior art. See the top pinned comment for more information.{% endraw %}
