{% raw %}In this video, I build the base cabinet for the bathroom vanity. The design is fairly simple, just a box that will house three large drawers. The construction is barebones, using stretchers instead of a solid bottom shelf and a back panel, but has a solid maple faceframe attached to the carcass with biscuits and glue.<br />In the next video, I'll apply the finish to this part of the cabinet. It will be stained a dark colour and I'll go through how I do that.<br /><br />The video on adding the supports to my miter saw station:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/RQTMjP6fODc">https://youtu.be/RQTMjP6fODc</a><br /><br />Here are some ways that you can help support the work I do in making these videos:<br /><br />Plans for sale: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ibuildit.ca/plans.html">http://www.ibuildit.ca/plans.html</a><br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=865843&amp;ty=h">https://www.patreon.com/user?u=865843&amp;ty=h</a><br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ibuildit.ca/">http://www.ibuildit.ca/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/I-Build-It-258048014240900/">https://www.facebook.com/I-Build-It-258048014240900/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/i_build_it.ca/">https://www.instagram.com/i_build_it.ca/</a><br />Google+: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107142665853474113931/">https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107142665853474113931/</a>{% endraw %}
