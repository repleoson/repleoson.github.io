Birlliant.org follows a bite-sized learning approach using interactive 2D animation. I have personally learned a lot from their website. <br /><br />When you learn to drive, the most difficult control to master is that of steering. Do you know there are some amazing physics and mechanisms beneath the steering wheel, which keeps the vehicle on the right track without any skidding of the wheels. This video will demonstrate why we need such mechanisms for steering, and how they work. We will also understand the workings of power steering mechanisms.<br /><br />Be a Learn Engineering supporter or contributor : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqZQJ4600a9wIfMPbYc60OQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqZQJ4600a9wIfMPbYc60OQ/join</a><br />instagram : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sabinzmathew/">https://www.instagram.com/sabinzmathew/</a><br />Twitter : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/sabinsmathew">https://twitter.com/sabinsmathew</a><br />Telegram : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.me/sabinmathew">https://t.me/sabinmathew</a><br /><br />Voice over artist : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fiverr.com/voiceonthemove">https://www.fiverr.com/voiceonthemove</a>{% endraw %}
