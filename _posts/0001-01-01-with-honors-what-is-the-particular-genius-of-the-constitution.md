{% raw %}Monty (Brendan Frasier) and Simon (Joe Pesci) attend a class with Mr. Pitkannan (Gore Vidal), in which Pitkannan questions whether the president is little more than an elected king, and Simon gets a chance to teach at Harvard.<br /><br />With Honors was released in 1994, by Warner Brothers, and Spring Creek Productions. For more information on the movie, go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111732/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111732/</a><br /><br />As usual, I recommend getting a copy of the full movie, and watching it. This is a great scene, but the complete movie is even better.{% endraw %}
