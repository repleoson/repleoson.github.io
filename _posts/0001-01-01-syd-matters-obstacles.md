{% raw %}Lyrics -<br />Lets say sunshine for everyone<br />But as far as I can remember<br />We've been migratory animals<br />Living under changing weather<br /><br />Someday we will foresee obstacles<br />Through the blizzard, through the blizzard<br />Today we will sell our uniform<br />Live together, live together<br /><br />We played hide and seek in waterfalls<br />We were younger, we were younger<br />We played hide and seek in waterfalls<br />We were younger, we were younger<br />We played hide and seek in waterfalls<br />We were younger, we were younger<br />We played hide and seek in waterfalls<br />We were younger, we were younger<br /><br />Someday we will foresee obstacles<br />Through the blizzard, through the blizzard<br /><br />COPYRIGHT Â© Third Side Records.
