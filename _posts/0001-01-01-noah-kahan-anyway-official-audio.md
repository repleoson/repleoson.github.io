Have you gotten sleep?<br />You said you were sorry, that you hadn’t called me in over a week <br />And I said <br /><br />Always, I’ll wait<br />For sharp glass when you break<br />I’ll be the light that you can’t make<br />I’ll be your eyes you be my face<br />Cuz darling I get scared for you and I’m not busy anyway<br /><br />I hope, I ain’t the last of what the world left you<br />A coat, something you only wear in cold weather<br /><br />Always, I’ll wait<br />For sharp glass when you break<br />I’ll be the light that you can’t make<br />I’ll be your eyes you be my face<br />Cuz darling I get scared for you and I’m not busy anyway{% endraw %}
