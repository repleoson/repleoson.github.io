{% raw %}Many of our students get confused about the difference between the words 'hope' and 'wish'. Teacher Zane explains.<br /><br />Speak English better with Avalon School London! Come join our English Language school to improve your speaking and listening skills in the heart of London.<br /><br />Contact us at: info@avalonschool.co.uk<br /><br />Our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.avalonschool.co.uk">https://www.avalonschool.co.uk</a><br /><br />Avalon is accredited by the British Council and enjoys a fantastic central location next to Leicester Square, Soho and Covent Garden. Many of London’s most popular tourist attractions are within easy walking distance.<br /><br />Avalon is the home of Avalon Quantum English (AQE), a teaching system that focuses on students’ speaking and listening skills which is used in a growing number of schools around the world. Many students come to Avalon having studied English before but without the ability or the confidence to actively use and comprehend the language. AQE teachers are specially trained to enable students to learn how to speak and comprehend natural and fluent English more confidently with emphasis on practice, correction and pronunciation.<br /><br />Avalon students study a minimum of two AQE or IELTS/Cambridge Exam classes a day with additional classes available in General Skills.<br /><br />Accommodation is provided with carefully selected homestay families, in student residences and in private shared student houses.<br /><br />The school has a varied social events calendar, including parties, guided walks and museum visits. We can arrange weekend trips to destinations outside London on request.<br /><br />Our social media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/avalonschoollondon/">https://www.facebook.com/avalonschoollondon/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/avalonschoollondon/">https://www.instagram.com/avalonschoollondon/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/avalonschoolLDN">https://www.twitter.com/avalonschoolLDN</a><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR0wlbjSN0OZLWVwUcK59wA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR0wlbjSN0OZLWVwUcK59wA</a><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/avalon-school-of-english/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/avalon-school-of-english/</a>{% endraw %}
