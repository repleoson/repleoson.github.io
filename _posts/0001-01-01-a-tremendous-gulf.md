{% raw %}Предложите свой вариант перевода фразы &quot;tremendous gulf&quot; <br />That sample you asked me to run I ran it, and it is quite good.<br />Thank you very much, Gale.<br />You can give that to Victor to discard.<br />Sure.<br />Is that our competition? I'm sorry? The It really is quite good.<br />The purity, of course, I'm speaking of speaking strictly in chemical terms.<br />And I can't, as of yet, account for the blue color but If that is our competition we have our work cut out for us so to speak.<br />You don't have any competition, Gale not as far as I'm concerned.<br />After all, how pure can pure be? Well, it can be pretty darn pure.<br />Mr.<br />Fring, I can guarantee you a purity of 96%.<br />I'm proud of that figure.<br />It's a hard-earned figure, 96.<br />However, this other product is 99 maybe even a touch beyond that.<br />I'd need an instrument called a gas chromatograph to say for sure, but that last 3%, it may not sound like a lot but it is.<br />It's tremendous.<br />It's a tremendous gulf.<br />Gale, for our purposes 96% will do just fine.<br />Please, don't let this trouble you.{% endraw %}
