I also discuss some tips and tricks and why female patients can be a little bit more  difficult then male patients to complete this task on. <br /><br />Follow along and study by answering these questions.<br />1. What allergies do we need to assess for when doing this skill?<br />2. What is an alternative to Betadine?<br />3. In what order do we use the Betadine swabs?<br />4.
