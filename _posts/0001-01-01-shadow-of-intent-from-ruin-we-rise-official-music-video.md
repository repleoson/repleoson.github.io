{% raw %}Merch Store: shadowofintent.com<br /><br />Music produced by Chris Wiseman and Christian Donaldson<br />Video directed by Joey Durango<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />Newcomers dance and sing<br />Relieved by the passing of spring<br />They feel the grace of the sun<br />Their misfortune has not yet begun<br />Where the men used to come for their drinks<br />Where the children would play endlessly<br />They have taken our everything<br />They know not what tomorrow shall bring<br />On the opposite side of the field<br />A vengeance that shall never yield<br />Fathers weep for their sons<br />Their suffering cannot be undone<br /><br />Why cry?<br />From squalor and ruin we rise<br />They reap what they've sown<br />Arise, arise<br />Past the horizon lay paradise<br />But here the rivers run red<br />Dregs of the world seen through their eyes<br />Less than the dung below the flies<br />Fields of the dead bake in the light<br />Children, women and men, their bodies lie<br />Piled in the streets stacked six feet high<br />Tell me why, oh why<br /><br />Limbs contorted<br />Anatomical morbid distortions<br />At a biblical limit the purging<br />In our hearts is a rage ever burning<br />Come the next morning<br />We attack with a thousand scornings<br />Look upon us like death is emerging<br />Beginning the righteous charge, disparaging<br /><br />Now it's our turn for the scourging<br />With a hatred relentlessly swarming<br />Skies wail as rockets are hurling<br />Falling down to earth screaming and bursting<br />Miles, miles and miles of corpses<br />They bear witness to vindictive forces<br />As far as the eyes can see<br />If you saw it you wouldn't believe it<br />When will these fucking wars end?{% endraw %}
