{% raw %}Affixes are word-parts that change the meaning of the words they attach to. &quot;Un-&quot; is a great example; when you're not happy, you're &quot;unhappy&quot;. &quot;Un-&quot; means &quot;not&quot;. It's a kind of affix we call a &quot;prefix&quot;.<br /><br />Khan Academy is a nonprofit organization with the mission of providing a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere.
