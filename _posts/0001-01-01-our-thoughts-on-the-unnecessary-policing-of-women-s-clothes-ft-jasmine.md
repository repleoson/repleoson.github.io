{% raw %}When it comes to what we wear - women just can’t seem to win. Our clothing choices are constantly held under the microscope. We have been told to cover up, but also to “not be a prude”. But how much skin is too much skin? How much of a woman's leg is acceptable to see in public? It’s time to recognise that our clothing is not the problem. <br /><br />In this episode of #HushPodcast, Hazelle, Azura, Germaine and our invited guest Jasmine Sokko discuss the unnecessary policing of women’s clothes, and fashion as an identity. They share with us personal stories from when they were judged for what they wear and their opinions on the topic.<br /><br />Featuring:<br />Hazelle - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/heyhihazelle">http://instagram.com/heyhihazelle</a><br />Germaine - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/germaineleonora">http://instagram.com/germaineleonora</a><br />Azura - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/azuragoh">http://instagram.com/azuragoh</a><br />Jasmine Sokko - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jasminesokko/">https://www.instagram.com/jasminesokko/</a><br /><br />Listen to #JasmineSokko new EP '25' here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFjaT0bw2LE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFjaT0bw2LE</a> <br /><br />About Hush Podcast:<br />At Hush, hosts &amp; Radio DJs Germaine Tan, Hazelle Teo and Azura Goh, discuss relationships, health and wellness topics that may be taboo or just plain paiseh to talk about. <br /><br />Follow Hush Podcast on Spotify &amp; Apple Podcast:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://spoti.fi/3bO7FfW​​">http://spoti.fi/3bO7FfW​​</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/2M3lcqy​​">https://apple.co/2M3lcqy​​</a> <br />(Podcasts are uploaded earlier!)<br /><br />Follow our Instagram for updates on Hush:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/itsclarity.co">https://www.instagram.com/itsclarity.co</a>{% endraw %}
