{% raw %}“Owner of my Heart” is the title track of The Choices’ debut EP released 2019 on Randale Records. Merchandise and music by The Choices available at www.randaleshop.de.<br /><br /><br />The Choices is a ’77 punk rock and power pop-infused female-fronted sensation. The band originated in January 2019 in the suburbs of Paris, a collaboration between French and Canadian lovers of The Buzzcocks, The Clash, The Stooges, and The Exploding Hearts. The sound mimics the low-fi, raw energy riffs of 1970s pure punk, while the harmonies and lyrics are greatly inspired by stories of love and life. The band released their first EP “Owner of My Heart” in November 2019 on Randale Records, and is currently touring throughout Europe to promote the release. If you’re looking for catchy refrains, rockn’roll riffs and punk rock attitudes – the choice is yours. Long live The Choices! <br /><br />Bookings: thechoicespunkrock@gmail.com<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thechoicespunkrock/">https://www.facebook.com/thechoicespunkrock/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/user-9226025">https://soundcloud.com/user-9226025</a><br /><br />Instagram: @the_choices_punkrock{% endraw %}
