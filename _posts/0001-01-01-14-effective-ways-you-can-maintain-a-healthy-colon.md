Stay Hydrated: The simplest way of keeping your colon clean is making sure that you get enough fluids. This will prevent fecal matter from becoming hard and dry. <br /><br />2. Apple Cider Vinegar:  Apple cider vinegar promotes the growth of healthy gut bacteria in your colon. At the same time, it also helps in cleansing the colon because of its antioxidant and antibiotic properties. <br /><br />3. Flax Seeds: Flax seed is very effective in cleansing the colon. It has both soluble and insoluble fibers which help in eliminating waste from your colon and maintaining the pH balance in it.<br /><br />4. Colon Flush: Colon flushes are a popular procedure that can wash out toxins and waste material that have become trapped in your colon.<br /><br />5. Increase Omega 3 Intake: Increasing your Omega 3 intake is a natural way to clean your colon. Omega-3 fatty acids are amazing colon cleansers because theyâ€™re incredibly powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents.<br /><br />6. Garcinia Cambogia: Garcinia Cambogia is a tropical fruit native to Indonesia. It is also known as Malabar Tamarind and is available mostly in supplement form. <br /><br />7. Sea Salt: Intake of salt water increases your bowel movements and helps expel various toxins, bacteria, and accumulated feces from your colon. The sodium in the salt pulls water from your tissues into your intestines.<br /><br />8. Fermented Foods: Fermented Foods like Yoghurt, kimchi, pickles and kefir contain high levels of probiotics. <br /><br />For more information and the rest of the list, please watch the video until the very end.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Subscribe to Bestie : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/tUqro6">https://goo.gl/tUqro6</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/">https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Medical Disclaimer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/xLmigD6i">https://pastebin.com/xLmigD6i</a>{% endraw %}
