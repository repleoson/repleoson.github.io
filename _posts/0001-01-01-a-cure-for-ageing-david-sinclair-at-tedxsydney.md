{% raw %}Can we really cure ageing?  David Sinclair thinks so, and he's going to try to prove it.<br /><br />David Sinclair is a scientist and entrepreneur working on increasing human health, productivity, and lifespan. After co-discovering a molecular cause of aging at the Massachusetts Institute in Boston in the mid-1990s, he joined the faculty of Harvard Medical School where he is now a tenured Professor. In 2005, he founded the Glenn Laboratories for Aging Research at Harvard and serves as their Co-Director. He is also a Professor at the Lowy Cancer Centre at the University of New South Wales, Sydney. <br /><br />His research is aimed at understanding why we grow old and using this knowledge to prevent and treat both rare and common diseases. He is perhaps best known for identifying resveratrol from red wine as an anti-aging molecule. He has founded four biotechnology companies; to treat age-related diseases (Sirtris), improve female reproductive health and IVF (OvaScience), treat type 2 diabetes (Cohbar), and develop vaccines against malaria, chlamydia, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and cancer (Genocea).<br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations){% endraw %}
