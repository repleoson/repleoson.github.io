The game is scheduled for release for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5 on September 21, 2021. The story follows Kena, a young spirit guide who uses her magical abilities to help deceased people move from the physical to the spirit world. The game is presented through a third-person perspective. The player uses Kena's staff for attacking enemies, and her pulse ability for defending against attacks. They are tasked with collecting small spirit companions known as the Rot, who help to complete tasks and battle against enemies.<br /><br />Kena: Bridge of Spirits is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. The player controls Kena, a young spirit guide with magical abilities. In combat, the player uses Kena's staff for light, heavy, and charged attacks. An upgrade transforms the staff into a bow. When defending against enemies, the player can activate Kena's pulse ability, which acts as a shield and has a health meter that depletes when attacked; it also serves to provide clues and activate objects.  The player is tasked with collecting small spirit companions known as the Rot. They can be directed to complete tasks, such as moving objects, taking certain shapes, or distracting enemies. The player must damage enemies before the Rot builds enough courage to join battles. The Rot can be customized with different hats. The game utilizes the DualSense controller's haptic feedback for features such as Kena's Spirit Bow.<br /><br />Kena: Bridge of Spirits is set in a fictional location which is not Kena's place of origin. The main village, which acts as the game's hub world, is abandoned at the beginning of the game, having been struck by a tragedy hundreds of years earlier. Throughout the game, Kena restores the area to an improved state. In the game's lore, deceased people can remain between the physical and spirit worlds if they are traumatized or feel unfinished. As a spirit guide, Kena tries to understand their difficulties and help them to move on. Kena has a scar from her hand to her shoulder, which represents a traumatic experience with her father that will be explored in the game. Other characters include Saiya and Beni, two young children whose teenage brother, Taro, is a restless spirit who Kena helps.{% endraw %}
