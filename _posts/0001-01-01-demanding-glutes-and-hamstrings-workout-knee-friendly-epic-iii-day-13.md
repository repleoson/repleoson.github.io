{% raw %}Hamstrings and glutes supersets involving hip thrusts, RDLs and elevated bridges! There are no squats or lunges in this workout though that doesn’t mean it is any easier! <br /><br />This really requires a lot from both the hamstrings and glutes in every exercise! <br /><br />For this glute &amp; hamstring session, you will need a pair of dumbbells and/or heavier weight such as one heavier dumbbell, barbell or kettlebell, your mat, Glute band, yoga block/thick book and a chair to elevate the feet during bridges and for hip thrusts!<br /><br />This is superset format so no specific rest between 2 exercises! However of course, like me, you might need a brief second to come to floor during the hip thrusts at points! <br /><br />The timer will be on for 50 seconds of work, straight into another 50 seconds of work before we have 20 seconds rest!<br /><br />If a superset begins on one side such as a single leg exercise, the next exercise within that same superset will still be on same side! It will be a variation to the first exercise such as dropping to one dumbbell or pulses etc! <br /><br />The dumbbells I am using for your reference are 15kg each and X1 dumbbell at 25kg for the hip thrusts.<br /><br />X1<br />ABDUCTION<br />BRIDGE TO ABDUCTION<br /><br />X1<br />PULSES<br />BRIDGE<br /><br />X2<br />PAUSE AT TOP HIP THRUSTS<br />HOLD!<br /><br />X3<br />1/2 REP HIP THRUSTS<br />FULL RANGE HIP THRUSTS<br /><br />X2<br />PAUSE AT BOTTOM RDL <br />1 1/2 REP RDL<br /><br />X1<br />BODYWEIGHT 1 1/2 REPS<br />FULL RANGE!<br /><br />X2<br />RDL X2 DUMBBELLS<br />1/2 REP RDL X1 DUMBBELL<br /><br />X2<br />ELEVATE HAMSTRING LIFT X1 DUMBBELL<br />BODYWEIGHT ONLY!
