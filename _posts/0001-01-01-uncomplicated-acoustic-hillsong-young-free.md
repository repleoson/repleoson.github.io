{% raw %}All Of My Best Friends (Acoustic) by Hillsong Young &amp; Free<br /><br />&quot;We made ‘All Of My Best Friends (Acoustic)’ during a season where we found ourselves singing these songs, more often than not, on a piano or an acoustic guitar. Although they were designed to be sung in live rooms with many people jumping and dancing, we found that there was an intimacy that came when we sung these songs this way. This album represents this season, our closeness to God and our need of Him.&quot; -- Aodhan King<br /><br />Click here to listen to the latest from Hillsong Young &amp; Free: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://yf.lnk.to/bestofYFplaylistID">https://yf.lnk.to/bestofYFplaylistID</a><br />Watch the original version of Uncomplicated: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/bIv5mIksNX0">https://youtu.be/bIv5mIksNX0</a><br />Listen to All Of My Best Friends (Acoustic): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://yf.lnk.to/aombfacoustic">https://yf.lnk.to/aombfacoustic</a><br /><br />Stay connected:<br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMedXf7FE/">https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMedXf7FE/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/youngandfree">https://instagram.com/youngandfree</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/hillsongyoungandfree">https://facebook.com/hillsongyoungandfree</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/youngandfree">https://twitter.com/youngandfree</a><br /><br />Uncomplicated<br />Words and Music by Jack McGrath, Brendan Tan, Joshua Grimmett &amp; Aodhan King<br />© 2020 Hillsong Music Publishing Australia<br />CCLI: 7147219<br /><br />VERSE 1:<br />There’s a<br />Simplicity<br />Humility<br />To the way You love me<br />An honesty<br />A purity<br />God You make it easy<br />No special words<br />Or formulas<br />Could ever win You over<br />For Your love is undeserved<br /><br />PRE-CHORUS 1:<br />Even when I can’t see clearly<br />Somehow You still make it easy<br /><br />CHORUS:<br />Your love’s uncomplicated<br />You love me just the way I am<br />So I stand before You<br />I’m totally surrendered<br />With open hands and open heart<br />Jesus have Your way in me<br /><br />VERSE 2:<br />Jesus have Your way in<br />My brokenness<br />My loneliness<br />And the secrets You see<br />My deepest thoughts<br />My hidden wars<br />God You see right through me<br /><br />PRE-CHORUS 2:<br />Even when I’m overthinking<br />Somehow You still love me simply<br /><br />BRIDGE:<br />I could sing over and over<br />I love You<br />It never grows old<br />How could I tell You enough<br />That I love You<br />I love You<br />Lord<br /><br />#HillsongYoungandFree #Uncomplicated #YoungAndFree{% endraw %}
