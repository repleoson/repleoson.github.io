{% raw %}I Am Fish full release gameplay! Playing Piranha level 3. I Am Fish is a fun physics based game from the makers of I Am Bread, where you play as a goldfish in a fish bowl, and the goal is to escape and make it to the ocean. They're calling it the &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to I Am Bread.<br /><br />Get I Am Fish here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1472560/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1472560/</a><br /><br />üò∫üé£ Cat Goes Fishing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2q3etlj">https://bit.ly/2q3etlj</a><br />üêùüåé Tasty Planet Forever: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2BQPGE4">https://bit.ly/2BQPGE4</a><br />üê†üêã Feed and Grow Fish: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/31OM9R2">https://bit.ly/31OM9R2</a><br /><br />Here is a description of I Am Fish by its developers Bossa Studios: I Am Fish is a charming, physics-based adventure starring four intrepid fish friends, forcibly separated from their home in a pet shop fish tank. Over the course of the game you join them as they swim, fly, roll and chomp their way to the open ocean from the far-flung corners of Barnardshire (the smallest county in England) in their bid for freedom and to re-unite once again.<br /><br />FINTASTIC FRIENDS<br />Meet our heroes! Goldfish - cheerful, brave, and adventurous, a natural born swimmer! Pufferfish ‚Äì a little slow but kind-hearted who can also puff up into a ball and roll across land. Piranha - wild, chaotic, loud, unpredictable, and loves to bite - obviously. Flying Fish ‚Äì a little aloof at times but a real softy at heart, with the ability to glide through the air! These plucky heroes will leave no bowl unturned, putting their heart and shoal into the mission to re-unite!<br /><br />NO NEED TO BE A BRAIN STURGEON<br />Swim, roll, glide, chomp, flip flop, inflate, fly and bite your way through enthralling challenges. A simple, intuitive control scheme leaves no excuses should your fish perish leaving you feeling very gill-ty.<br /><br />THINK OUTSIDE THE BOWL<br />With its idyllic coastline and quaint villages Barnardshire might seem like a perfect slice of quintessential tranquility, but to our aquatic adventurers it‚Äôs alive with the very real threats presented by crossing roads, traversing rooftops, dodging deep fat fryers, avoiding wildlife including the cantankerous locals, not to mention fragile fishbowls and the very real problem that fish can‚Äôt breathe out of water.<br /><br />LEAVE NO FISH BEHIND<br />We won‚Äôt dwell on grizzly fish death, but should your fish fall too far in whatever make-shift fishbowl it finds itself in, run out of air or generally flounder you will be popped back to the most recent checkpoint to refine your approach.<br /><br />SWIM TO FREEDOM<br />Our four fin-tastic friends will be hitching rides in all manner of ad hoc water carriers including jars, mop buckets on wheels and the occasional pint glass. Cheers! Navigating in each make-shift aquatic vehicle poses its own unique challenge, but don‚Äôt worry, the relative freedom of open water is never too far away with inviting fountains, swimming pools and err, sewers full of hazardous materials to splash around in, before reaching the final goal ‚Äì the shimmering, open ocean.<br /><br />Bossa Studios are also responsible for the fun games I Am Bread and Surgeon Simulator.<br /><br />Enjoy the video?
