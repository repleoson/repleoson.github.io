{% raw %}UCR is an International Honors College of Utrecht University, based in Middelburg, The Netherlands. We offer a Liberal Arts and Sciences program. This means that no student follows the exact same educational path at our university. This is because the we allow you to design your own curriculum from approximately 200 courses across four academic departments. You can therefore build your own Bachelor’s program based on your interests and passions and, depending on the major you choose, graduate with a BSc or BA in three years. In this video we explain how our program is structured and what you can expect from three years at UCR.
