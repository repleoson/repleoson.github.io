{% raw %}Ok guys customer states they had to swerve out of the way of something to only HIT A BIG A$$ ROCK. Well they hit this rock not once but twice! first shot was to the right front and second shot was to the right rear. I really think  it happened in this video, I think something snapped. Not in the car, in my head! I drove the car in like this and drove it out. Getting it into the shop was difficult not to mention getting it onto the lift and back out of the shop. This might just be TOP 3 CSW!? About 14k in damage!<br /><br />Alot of damage could of been avoided if we had a normal post lift and at ground level not in a basement. I told them that bringing in the vehicle into the shop more damage will happen but adjuster needed pics and to inspect for quote. I tried to do what I can with what I was given.{% endraw %}
