In this context, flourishing means that the person enjoys feelings of happiness, contentment and curiosity and is able to engage fully with what is going on around them<br /><br />Flourishing also means functioning well in the world; the person experiences positive relationships, has some control over their life and has a sense of purpose<br /><br />Wellbeing therefore isn’t simply the opposite of ill-being; just looking at what causes distress won’t necessarily help us to identify the factors that give rise to wellbeing<br /><br />Many researchers in the field have worked over many years to be able to more closely define wellbeing – with many agreeing that it is a global assessment of a person’s quality of life according to his or her own chosen criteria<br /><br />The World Health Organisation agree that this is a broad ranging concept affected in a complex way by the person’s physical health, psychological state, personal beliefs, social relationships and their relationship to features of their environment<br /><br />Understanding the role of our environments and in particular our built environment is an important area of research as we spend up to 90% of our time as humans either inside buildings or vehicles<br /><br />If we can design and construct buildings that improve our wellbeing, why wouldn’t we?{% endraw %}
