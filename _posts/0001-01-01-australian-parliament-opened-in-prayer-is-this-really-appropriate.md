{% raw %}In 2014, a time when no religion and diversity amongst religious faith is growing, should Australia, a secular nation, really be opening their Parliament with a prayer to the Christian God. At the last census the breakdown of religion was as follows:<br /><br />Protestant 38.3%<br />Roman Catholic 25.3%<br />No religion 22.3%<br />No response 9.4%<br />Eastern Orthodox  2.6%<br />Buddhism 2.5%<br />Islam 2.2%<br />Hinduism 1.3%<br />Judaism 0.4%<br />Other 1.2%<br /><br />Shouldn't a body that is meant to represent the Australian people, without favour or discrimination avoid pledging themselves to a select God, alienating a large % of Australians?<br /><br />What do you think? Are you a Christian or from another faith, or no faith? Does the opening of Parliament with the Lord's Prayer bother you?<br /><br /> #auspol<br /><br />Check out our store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://auspol.shirtee.net.au/">http://auspol.shirtee.net.au/</a><br />Follow on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/auspol_youtube">https://twitter.com/auspol_youtube</a><br /><br />Don't forget to comment.{% endraw %}
