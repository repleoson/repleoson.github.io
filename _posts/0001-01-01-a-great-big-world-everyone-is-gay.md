{% raw %}Awhile ago, our friends Kristin and Dannielle (who run a website called EveryoneIsGay.com that offers advice to LGBTQ youth) challenged us to write the &quot;gayest song ever&quot; for a compilation. And this song was the result!  We believe in their mission and stand by all those who live in fear of being their authentic selves. NO ONE deserves to be bullied or treated unfairly based on sexual preference. Diversity should be celebrated!<br /><br />Thank you to Kristin and Dannielle at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.EveryoneIsGay.com">http://www.EveryoneIsGay.com</a> for inspiring this!!!<br /><br />And a huuuuuge thank you to the following people for spending countless hours making this beautifully joyous video and music!! We hope you enjoy it and spread the word that EVERYONE IS GAY!
