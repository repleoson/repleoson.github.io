{% raw %}This is a re-upload to correct some terminology.<br />In the previous version we suggested that the terms “odds” and “probability” could be used interchangeably.  While this may be okay in casual conversation (since both have to do with the likelihood of an event), the two terms mean something slightly different in math and are calculated differently.  We apologize for any confusion.{% endraw %}
