{% raw %}We prepared an amazing feast for our cats and Walter to celebrate the 1M subs milestone! And we let them choose what to eat by allowing them to spin the wheel full of delicious meals! There are chicken, fish and beef in the menu; let's see what our cats will choose!<br /><br />My email address: waltersantindy@gmail.com<br />Our Instagram page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/waltersantindy">https://www.instagram.com/waltersantindy</a><br />Our second channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/FeedandTravel">https://www.youtube.com/FeedandTravel</a><br /><br />About Our Channel:<br />This channel is about the daily lives and adventures of my three indoor cats Santi, Indy &amp; Chewie and our 13 outdoor cats and my dog Walter.<br />Our outdoor cats are living in our garden and their names are D'Artagnan, The Rolling Cat, The Purring Cat, D'Artagnan's Girlfriend, Porthos, Zoom, Ruzgar, Junior, The Mom Cat, The Big Head, Pamuk Jr and Nope. We also have Pamuk who is our neighbor's cat but always hangs out here.<br />If you are a new visitor to our channel, I suggest that you watch the two playlists called &quot;All The Videos of Our Outdoor Cats (In Order)&quot; and &quot;All The Videos of My Indoor Cats (In Order)&quot; first.<br />Apart from the videos of our cats, from time to time I also upload videos of other animals I come across.<br />So basically, what you'll find here are lots of funny and cute cat videos, an ongoing miniseries about a cat love drama, sometimes rescue stories and always a whole lot of meowing! Enjoy!<br /><br />Music:<br />The Curious Kitten, Across The Savannah - Aaron Kenny<br />Blue Creek Trail, Birds in Flight, Wave in the Atmosphere, The Opening - Dan Lebowitz{% endraw %}
