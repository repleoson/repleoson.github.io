{% raw %}In this lesson, I explain Adornments, how to make them smart, and how to use adornment designators to have OnAdd functions use the adornments context to modify the value of notes. All these techniques can be particularly useful when analyzing many notes (originals and aliases).<br /><br /><br />Lesson Reference File<br />You‚Äôll find a Tinderbox reference file for this video on the Tinderbox Forum: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://forum.eastgate.com/t/tinderbox-training-video-adornments-smart-adornments-and-adornment-designators/3978.">http://forum.eastgate.com/t/tinderbox-training-video-adornments-smart-adornments-and-adornment-designators/3978.</a><br /><br />Need more help with Tinderbox?<br />If you need more help with Tinderbox, come on over to the Tinderbox Forum, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://forum.eastgate.com/,">https://forum.eastgate.com/,</a> a vibrant community with members the revel in helping each other.
