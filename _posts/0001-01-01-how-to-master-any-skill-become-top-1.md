Laido is one of 4 jugglers who have ever been able to juggle 11 rings at the same time (without a holster) - so he is definitely someone who is at the top of the field for his particular skill. <br /><br />His secret to success all comes down to the unique way that he practices. He uses a unique form of deliberate practice / purposeful practice which we will go over in this video. Pay close attention if you've been looking for a way to learn new skills and also to excel/rise to the top 1% for that particular skill. <br /><br />üëâ My NEW Storytelling Course (Watch It For Free Via Free Trial): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://share.graphyapp.co/7RuH">https://share.graphyapp.co/7RuH</a><br /><br />üêíTamed Course (FREE Habit Building Course): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/m8JjuyRIxOg">https://youtu.be/m8JjuyRIxOg</a> <br /><br />üêùBeeFriend Course (FREE Social Skills Course): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHfGgOfmbx4&amp;list=PLE_vQWWxgaiHbUFDuNnqxfui3lrE2jjwO&amp;index=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHfGgOfmbx4&amp;list=PLE_vQWWxgaiHbUFDuNnqxfui3lrE2jjwO&amp;index=1</a> <br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏èOtter Half Course (FREE Dating Advice For Men/Women Course): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X192TfMLIHU&amp;list=PLE_vQWWxgaiFgkO0OkThMgAEUChL_NQ8y&amp;index=3&amp;t=0s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X192TfMLIHU&amp;list=PLE_vQWWxgaiFgkO0OkThMgAEUChL_NQ8y&amp;index=3&amp;t=0s</a> <br /><br />The Online Business Playlist (will be gradually adding to this over time): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e7ONbUG58o&amp;list=PLE_vQWWxgaiGds5wLnOr2Db3Oncmt6F5U&amp;index=3&amp;t=0s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e7ONbUG58o&amp;list=PLE_vQWWxgaiGds5wLnOr2Db3Oncmt6F5U&amp;index=3&amp;t=0s</a><br /><br />For Business/Animation Job Inquiries: Email Me At ImprovementPill@Gmail.com<br /><br />Who Is Laido Dittmar: (00:00)<br />The Secret: (00:33)<br />Easiest Way To Start Improving - Deep End Practice: (01:35)<br />How To Perfect: (02:51)<br />Summary + Sponsor + Easter Egg: (03:41){% endraw %}
