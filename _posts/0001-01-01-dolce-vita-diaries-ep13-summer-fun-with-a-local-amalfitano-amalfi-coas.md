{% raw %}I filmed this episode 7 years ago but I thought so many of you might like a little summer Amalfi Coast escapism. As though of you who follow my channel more regularly know, I now live in Tuscany. This was filmed back when I was living in Positano. You can find many more videos on my channel about how I learned Italian and moved to Italy. Making these episodes alone is very time consuming and expensive and if you would like to support my work, you can find my Patreon page here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/KylieFlavell">https://www.patreon.com/KylieFlavell</a><br />You can find my recipes and other information on moving to Italy, learning Italian or my filmmaking equipment on my website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kylieflavell.com/">https://www.kylieflavell.com/</a><br />Please don't follow me on Facebook as that person is not me - they have stolen my identity for the past few years. You can follow me over on Instagram for daily inspiration from Italy and around the world to make you dream, learn a language, cook, travel, move to a foreign country, film, edit or pursue your passion:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kylieflavell">https://www.instagram.com/kylieflavell</a><br />#Italy #amalfi #amalficoast{% endraw %}
