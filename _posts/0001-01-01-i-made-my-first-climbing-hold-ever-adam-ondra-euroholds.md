{% raw %}Welcome to Xàtiva! A small town nearby Valencia, Spain, with 30 thousand inhabitants, a nice historical feeling, and the home of a top-notch climbing holds company @Euroholds. I've had the opportunity to meet a lot of great, hard-working, open-minded people here who are involved in the climbing holds movement. It ain't just the holds we are so excited about, but also the possibilities in how we can communicate what we work on. <br /><br />I spent countless hours and days perfecting my skills and techniques on how to train better, more efficiently, and in such a way as to minimize any injuries. I enjoy every bit of it, no matter how excruciatingly tiring the training might sometimes be. It's all part of the never-ending learning process. Something that I wish to share one day with anybody who cares to listen. And it just happened. Be it a hold manufacturer seeking the perfect hold shape, a pro climber working on her or his project, or anybody excited about climbing, no matter the grade. <br /><br />Ready to join the new era of the climbing holds?
