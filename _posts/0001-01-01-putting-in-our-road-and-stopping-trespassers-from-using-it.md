{% raw %}This video takes you back to our first project on our off grid homestead in North Idaho. We put in a gravel driveway to our home build site, and also a security farm gate to keep out trespassers. <br /><br />We needed to get in our well, septic, and foundation so putting in a solid private road was at the top of our list. This new chapter is going to be a huge adventure for our family as we build our second homestead from the ground up using what we learned homesteading and farming our single acre in SW Washington State.<br /><br />To see more find us on facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/goodsimpleliving">https://www.facebook.com/goodsimpleliving</a><br />And <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.Instagram.com/goodsimpleliving">https://www.Instagram.com/goodsimpleliving</a><br /><br />Mailing Address:<br />PO Box 547<br />Battle Ground, WA 98604<br /><br />like our safe and comfy silicon Groove rings?
