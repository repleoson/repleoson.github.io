{% raw %}In this video, learn the difference between: 'cannot', 'can not' and 'can't'. <br /><br />Cannot is the negative form of the verb can. Simply replace 'can' with 'cannot' to make the sentence negative. Notice how 'cannot' is one word, with two n's. <br /><br />Can't is the contracted form of 'cannot'. You can think of it as the short form. To use it, simply replace 'can' with 'can't' to make the sentence negative. 'Can't' is the most common choice in American English and using it will help you sound fluent and natural. <br /><br />'Can not' is not the negative form of the verb can. If you use it as the negative form, it's a spelling mistake. It is grammatically possible to have 'can' and 'not' side by side in a sentence. This can happen if the verb of your sentence is 'can' and then you have an expression with not, like 'not only X, but also Y'. This isn't common, but it is possible. <br /><br />Watch the lesson now to learn these rules in detail so you can learn English grammar and feel confident using 'cannot' 'can not' and 'can't'. <br /><br />Please subscribe for more videos to help you learn English and sound like a native English speaker!  <br /><br /><br /><br />Let’s Connect: <br /><br /><br /><br />Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/JForrestEnglish">https://www.facebook.com/JForrestEnglish</a> <br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JForrestEnglish">https://twitter.com/JForrestEnglish</a><br /><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-forrest">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-forrest</a><br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.jforrestenglish.com/">http://www.jforrestenglish.com/</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />Free Guide – Speak English Fluently &amp; Confidently in 6 Easy Steps.
