{% raw %}Presenting Andy Black - &quot;They Don't Need To Understand&quot;<br /><br />Directed by Patrick Fogarty<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Growing strong, the voice of my father said &quot;don't give it up, don't be forgotten&quot; <br />This hell on earth, I just want to run away <br />They told dreams don't grow from here. Stay alone, count your fears <br />Somewhere down the line I might figure it out <br /><br />Singing all my songs to bedroom mirrors <br />Deep inside my heart I am still here.<br /><br />We're always running away and we don't even stop to think about it <br />The worlds in our hands <br />They don't need to understand.<br />We do it our own way, no matter what they try to say about about it.<br />We've got our own plans <br />They don't need to understand <br /><br />What made me tough almost killed me..at least that's how I remember the story.<br />Over the years I've forgotten how it was<br />But I survived and I won't walk down the same old road that they all followed<br />It only leads to a life not meant for me <br /><br />We're always running away and we don't even stop to think about it <br />The worlds in our hands <br />They don't need to understand.<br />We do it our own way, no matter what they try to say about about it.<br />The worlds in our hands <br />And They don't need to understand <br /><br />Streets of my hometown seem strange now.<br />They feel like a distant memory.<br />I'm always fighting' cause I know you're trying' but you can never take this dream from me. <br /><br />We're always running away and we don't even stop to think about it <br />The worlds in our hands <br />They don't need to understand.<br />We do it our own way, no matter what they try to say about about it.<br />The worlds in our hands <br />And They don't need to understand <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/officialandyblack">http://www.facebook.com/officialandyblack</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/andyblack">http://www.twitter.com/andyblack</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/andyblack">http://www.instagram.com/andyblack</a>{% endraw %}
