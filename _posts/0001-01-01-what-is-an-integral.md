{% raw %}A Riemann sum is introduced as a way to estimate the area between a function and the x axis over an interval and then used to define a definite integral. The concept of net area is introduced, and the fundamental theorem of calculus is introduced as a way to evaluate indefinite integrals by treating integration and differentiation as inverses of each other.{% endraw %}
