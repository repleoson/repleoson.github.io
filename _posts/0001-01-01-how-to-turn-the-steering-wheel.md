{% raw %}A video on how to turn the steering wheel. The good, the bad, and the dangerous methods. I explain the methods hand over hand, &quot;milking the cow&quot;, and &quot;washing the dishes&quot; (these are the names I gave them by the way, nothing official). This is a topic where there is a lot of debate, and these are my personal opinions. So remember to always use whatever method is required where you are driving. <br /><br />For any info:<br />My website: www.conduitefacile.com<br />Gmail: conduitefacilevideos@gmail.com<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/conduitefacilevideos">https://www.facebook.com/conduitefacilevideos</a><br />Google+: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+ConduiteFacile">https://plus.google.com/+ConduiteFacile</a><br />Twitter:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ConduiteFacile">https://twitter.com/ConduiteFacile</a><br /><br />Note: How you turn the wheel is usually a preference rather than a law or rule. However, some places might require you to turn it a certain way at the exam. So make sure that you do what's required wherever you do your exam. While I try to make my videos as universal as possible, rules and laws may vary according to the place where youâ€™re driving and might be different from the ones in this video. Always drive according to the laws and rules that apply to the place where you are driving. Requirements at the driving exam may also be different than the ones shown here. Always respect the requirements that apply to the place where you are passing your driving exam. This video is not meant to replace your official driving courses.{% endraw %}
