Although, you won't make it without water.<br /><br />Vitamins <br />The basic function of these nutrients is to keep away diseases and keep you healthy. Without a healthy dose of Vitamins, it would be difficult for your body to fight the microorganisms. <br /><br />Protein<br />This is the nutrient that gets most of the hype. Go to any nutritionist and they will suggest a lot of food items for the proper intake of protein. These include meat, eggs, and some grains.<br /><br />Fats<br />Yes, the nutrient that you want to avoid. Well, maybe you shouldn't avoid it so much after all. Of course, an excessive amount of fats may be very dangerous for our body. Too much fat can cause problems for our blood pressure levels and heart as well as our digestive and respiratory systems. <br /><br />Minerals<br />When we talk about minerals for our body, the first thing that might come to mind is Calcium. Although this it isn't the only one. Don't forget about iron and Zinc.<br /><br />Carbohydrates<br />While the world is moving towards a low-carb diet, it still is one of the most important nutrients for our body. Carbohydrates serves as food for your brain and your central nervous system.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Subscribe to Bestie : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/tUqro6">https://goo.gl/tUqro6</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/">https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Medical Disclaimer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/xLmigD6i">https://pastebin.com/xLmigD6i</a>{% endraw %}
