And lots more cool stuff from choosing a skit topic to writing the video!<br /><br />This was filmed in NYC in front of SWARMS of tourists who I'm sure paid to see the landmarks but instead spent their entire 2 hours staring at me. <br /><br />No Stevens were harmed in this production. <br /><br />Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thestevenhe/">https://www.instagram.com/thestevenhe/</a><br /><br />reddit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StevenHe/">https://www.reddit.com/r/StevenHe/</a><br /><br />#comedy #skit #asian{% endraw %}
