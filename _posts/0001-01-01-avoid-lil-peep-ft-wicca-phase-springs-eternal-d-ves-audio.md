DØVES]<br />You'll only see us in the back<br />GothBoiClique, all black<br />I knew love once, it's hard to forget<br />I thought of you and nights spent<br />When I'm backed against the wall<br />I thought of her and highly<br />'Cause she answered when I called<br />I want her to wanna hurt me<br />And I miss 2013 love songs<br />And I'm so lost, under club lights<br />In the all black, GothBoiClique<br /><br />[Chorus: Lil Peep]<br />GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid<br />No choice, baby, I be makin' noise<br />GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid<br />No choice, no choice<br />Lookin' for you in the back of the club<br />Lookin' for her in the back of the club, fucked up<br />Everybody know I numb it with the drugs<br />Everybody know I numb it with the drugs<br /><br />[Verse 2: WICCA PHASE SPRINGS ETERNAL &amp; DØVES]<br />Fucked up in the back of the club<br />Cast a sigil in the back of the club<br />I got scars on me, no love<br />Light a candle and I pray for Døves<br />And you're fadin' away, like the pill under my tongue<br />We seriously never even touched, it sucks<br />I'ma put your name in my skin, mix the ink in my blood<br />It's so fucked<br />So tell me what is love<br />If I ever had it, if I ever had it<br />Did I really want it?<br />And why can't I remember?<br />I cannot remember<br />I took the black two-seater when you pushed me away<br />Into the dark, I only want what's best for you, baby<br />I reach out to you, but slowly<br />If there's passion there, then show me<br />Fast, hard<br />It's a slow drug<br />And I swear that<br />But it's true love<br />These are true lines<br /><br />[Verse 3: DØVES]<br />Saw you in the back of the club again<br />And we just started textin' again<br />And now you sendin' pictures to my phone, like I just can't resist<br />I'm tryin' not to let you feel missed (Tryin' so hard)<br />And now we're in the bar, like 6 PM<br />And now we took a bottle to your bed<br />Listenin' to Slowdive, eyes like so-so red<br />And I can't stop starin' at the back of your neck<br />And you think you can make me love again<br />I swear that I will never feel a thing<br />Hollow shell, quiet hell, but you're so into me<br />Screamin', &quot;Why don't you love me back?!&quot;<br />'Cause it's GothBoiClique, 'til my lungs collapse<br /><br />[Chorus: Lil Peep]<br />GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid<br />No choice, baby, I be makin' noise<br />GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid<br />No choice, no choice<br />Lookin' for you in the back of the club<br />Lookin' for her in the back of the club, fucked up<br />Everybody know I numb it with the drugs<br />Everybody know I numb it with the drugs<br /><br />#avoid #LilPeep #ComeOverWhenYoureSoberPt1{% endraw %}
