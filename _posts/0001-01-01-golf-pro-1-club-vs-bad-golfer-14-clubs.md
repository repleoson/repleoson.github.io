This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! <br /><br />I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. <br /><br />I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. <br />I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! <br /><br />On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes “gimmicky” golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. <br /><br />If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video.{% endraw %}
