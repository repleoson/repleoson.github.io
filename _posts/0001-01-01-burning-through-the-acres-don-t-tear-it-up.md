{% raw %}Hi everyone, thats right, we are burning through the acres. We are right around half finished with corn harvest now. Come along and check out some sights and sounds of the harvest. Thanks for the support through my cancer journey, your thoughts and prayers are surely appreciated. <br /><br />Harmless Farmer<br />PO Box 844<br />West Liberty, Ohio 43357{% endraw %}
