{% raw %}During the initial stages of World War II, the Third Reich shocked the world with its Blitzkrieg attacks on all battlefronts. And while the Nazi's military efficiency is commonly attributed to their technological superiority and innovative warfare strategies, there was an extra incentive that changed the course of the war.<br /><br />Every officer in every level of the Wehrmacht carried another weapon in its pocket: performance-enhancing methamphetamines. <br /><br />This and other drugs were ultimately used by both sides of the conflict, but it is widely recognized that the consumption of this extreme superdrug was one of the main reasons behind the Nazisâ€™ fall.<br /><br /><br />- As images and footage of actual events are not always available, Dark Docs sometimes utilizes similar historical images and footage for dramatic effect.
