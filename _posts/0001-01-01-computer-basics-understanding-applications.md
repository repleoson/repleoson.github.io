{% raw %}No matter what type of device you have, you'll need to use applications (or &quot;apps&quot;). Applications allow you to do all kinds of things, from creating documents, to viewing videos, to playing games. We're going to show some examples of how you might use apps.<br /><br />For example, if you have a smartphone, you can use an app like Google Maps to search for a coffee shop. It will use location data from your phone to find nearby coffee shops, and then it can give you turn-by-turn directions to the one you choose. <br /><br />We hope you enjoy!
