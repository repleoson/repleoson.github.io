{% raw %}This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. In a world of Smartphones and Smart Cars. What does Smart really mean?<br /><br />Chris Kennedy is the father of four young children and the husband to an amazing woman. When not busy as a husband and father he is the Superintendent of Schools with the West Vancouver School District. Chris is a passionate teacher and strong advocate for public education.<br /><br />About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations){% endraw %}
