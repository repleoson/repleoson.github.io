{% raw %}What is important? This is a question that philosophy has investigated for at least 2500 years. Many answers have been offered, but also methods for how to assess these answers. I will talk about this cultural treasure and how it can be made more available. And why it should be. In brief, I propose that the question &quot;what is important?&quot; is one of the most important questions we can ask ourselves, and that if we don't give our own answer to it, someone else will.<br /><br />I am an associate professor of philosophy at Umeå university. I am also a philosophical counselor and facilitator. I have discussed philosophy, in a professional capacity, with everything from 5-graders to people in their middle-age considering a change of career or life partner. My current research project is focused on close personal relationships and what norms and laws structure and should structure our life opportunities in this important area.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
