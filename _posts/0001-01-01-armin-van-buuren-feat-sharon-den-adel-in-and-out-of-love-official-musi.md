Inspired and influenced by many different types of music, 'Mirage' is more diverse than any other Armin album before. His collaboration with Sophie Ellis-Bextor, 'Not Giving Up On Love' is a perfect example of that, combining the best of both worlds. Armin:&quot;The Nervo Sisters, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and me met up to write the vocals for 'Not Giving Up On Love'. I was thrilled to work with them on this. We gave it a more analog feel with some real drums, to give it a pop-rock feel. We also put a piano top line on the track and then the vocals of Sophie, which I think is a win. It's a lush summer tune with an epic vocal that gets stuck in your head and cheers you up!&quot;<br /><br />'Mirage' is filled with musical fusions and surprising interpretations, from the orchestral masterpiece of title track 'Mirage', deep trance track 'I Don't Own You' and housy 'Feels So Good' to the eerie 'Take A Moment' and feel-good 'Drowning'. 16 tracks that highlight how Armin has matured as an artist.<br /><br />Connect with Armada Music<br />▶<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/armadamusic">https://www.instagram.com/armadamusic</a><br />▶<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/armadamusic">https://www.facebook.com/armadamusic</a><br />▶<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/armada">https://www.twitter.com/armada</a><br />▶<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.soundcloud.com/armadamusic">https://www.soundcloud.com/armadamusic</a><br />▶<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.armadamusic.com">https://www.armadamusic.com</a><br /><br />#ArmadaMusic<br />#ArminvanBuuren<br />#InAndOutOfLove{% endraw %}
