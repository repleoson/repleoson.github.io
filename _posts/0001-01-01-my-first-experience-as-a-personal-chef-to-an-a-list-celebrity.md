{% raw %}This is how it started….<br /><br />Imagine a SUPERSTAR messages you and tells you he wants you to COOK FOR HIM. At first I wondered whether this was actually happening! I had to DROP EVERYTHING that I was doing and COOK up something VERY SPECIAL  for him. <br /><br />I apologise for the quality of the video as I literally only had 3 hours to SHOP, MARINATE, COOK and drop it off to his hotel.<br /><br />I had doubts but it’s only until I arrived outside the Bulgari hotel and was greeted by his security, I realised this wasn’t a hoax and it was for REAL! <br /><br />Security handed my car keys to concierge to park my car and escorted me straight to the PRESIDENTIAL SUITE.<br /><br />It felt so surreal, I walked into the suite, with his music playing in the background. The suite looked INCREDIBLE. <br /><br />The security guard introduced me to the superstar’s assistant.<br /><br />I couldn’t believe this was happening, I was there in the SAME ROOM as someone who I ABSOLUTELY LOVE, I’ve been his BIGGEST FAN and now he was about to try MY COOKING! This was something I couldn’t have even imagined in my WILDEST OF DREAMS!<br /><br />I heated and plated up all of the food. I then walked into the room and served the superstar! As I walked into the room, I realised another superstar was sitting across the dining table. <br /><br />I stood watching from the kitchen as they finished the dinner and to my surprise he turned around and said “Your food is fire and You throw it down in the kitchen”.<br /><br />I was SPEECHLESS he absolutely loved it! I couldn’t believe it. <br /><br />It was the MOST INCREDIBLE feeling I can’t even put into words. I didn’t think this experience could have got any better until the other superstar who had joined him for dinner asked for me to come back and cook for him for the NEXT FOUR DAYS! The evening felt like a blur! <br /><br />Life experiences like these NEVER HAPPEN to ORDINARY PEOPLE like me but today was DIFFERENT, TODAY was an opportunity that GOD had given to me! <br />I am so GRATEFUL for all of the SUPPORT I have received from all my FAMILY, FRIENDS and FOLLOWERS. This wouldn’t have been possible without you ALL.{% endraw %}
