{% raw %}If you're like me, then the sound of an air conditioner puts you right to sleep. Now with our virtual AC, you don't have to wait for a hot summer day to enjoy the soothing sound. Fall asleep quickly, block out noisy distractions and stay asleep all night long with the 10 hour HD recording.<br /><br />***<br /><br />DISCLAIMER:<br /><br />Remember that loud sounds can potentially damage your hearing. When playing one of our videos, if you cannot have a conversation over the sound without raising your voice, the sound may be too loud for your ears. Please do not place speakers right next to a baby’s ears. If you have difficulty hearing or hear ringing in your ears, please immediately discontinue listening to the white noise sounds and consult an audiologist or your physician. <br /><br />The sounds provided by this Youtube channel are for entertainment purposes only and are not a treatment for sleep disorders or tinnitus. If you have significant difficulty sleeping on a regular basis, experience fitful/restless sleep, or feel tired during the day, please consult your physician.<br /><br />© Relaxing White Noise LLC, 2012.
