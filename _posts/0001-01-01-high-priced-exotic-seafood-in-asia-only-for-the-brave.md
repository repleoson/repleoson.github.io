I’m from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. <br /><br />If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture. <br /><br />Select footage/photos taken from: <br />Treasure Chest Candy Cane Sea Cucumber 2.Jpg by FredD Q Phia (Flickr) licensed under CC BY (@s/by/2.0)<br /><br />Actinopyga Echinites1.Jpg By François Michonneau licensed under CC BY (@s/by/3.0)<br /><br />Helenota Anax Géante.Jpg By Julien Bidet For Mdc Seamarc licensed under CC BY-SA (@s/by-sa/4.0)<br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />🎬CREDITS:<br />DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY » Nguyễn Tân Khải <br />CAMERA OPERATOR » Nguyễn Minh Đức<br />VIDEO EDITOR » Lê Anh Đỗ<br />PRODUCER » Huỳnh Hà My<br />ON THE GROUND PRODUCER » Khoi Chung<br />COLOR &amp; MASTER » Quí Nguyễn<br /><br />Selected tracks via Audio Network <br />For business inquiries: marketing@befrs.com{% endraw %}
