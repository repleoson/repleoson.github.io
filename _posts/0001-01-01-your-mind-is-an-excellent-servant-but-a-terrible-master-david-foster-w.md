{% raw %}David Foster Wallace (February 21, 1962 â€“ September 12, 2008) was an American writer and university professor in the disciplines of English and creative writing. This speech is from his graduation address at Kenyon College in 2005. <br /><br />The most profound ideas are the most difficult to articulate because they express thoughts that transcend words. Many of us struggle through life because we are stuck in our &quot;default setting&quot;, where we unconsciously see ourselves as the absolute center of the universe. David Foster Wallace presents an alternative way to see the world in this timeless speech. <br /><br />This animation took over a month to create.
