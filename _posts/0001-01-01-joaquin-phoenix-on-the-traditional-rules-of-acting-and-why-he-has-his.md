{% raw %}For acclaimed actor Joaquin Phoenix, the acting process is a mystery. The three-time Oscar nominee says the idea of getting into character is something he's never quite understood and doesn't want to. Speaking with Salon's Andrew O'Hehir about playing a traumatized veteran in writer and director Lynne Ramsay’s “You Were Never Really Here,&quot; Phoenix shares why making unconscious decisions is where he finds his characters.<br /><br />“I try not to make rules about the character,&quot; Phoenix told SalonTV. &quot;I don’t like that idea [of saying] ‘my character would never do that.’ I don’t know what the f**k they’d do. Anything’s possible.&quot; Phoenix took home the best actor award at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival for the role in the thrilling &quot;You Were Never Really Here.&quot; <br /><br />He opens up to SalonTV about the pacing of his career and why he often takes breaks from acting, then works intensely on several projects at a time. As far as developing a style to his work, Phoenix doesn’t get hung up on defining himself, but his non-definitions are those of a true artist.<br /><br />---<br />Subscribe to SalonTV’s Channel HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/salontv">https://www.youtube.com/salontv</a><br />For more content from SalonTV, click HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://video.salon.com">https://video.salon.com</a><br />Like Salon on Facebook HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/salon">https://www.facebook.com/salon</a><br />Follow Salon on Twitter HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/salon">https://twitter.com/salon</a><br />Follow Salon on Instagram HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/salonofficial">https://www.instagram.com/salonofficial</a><br /><br />Watch SalonTV daily at 12 PM ET / 9 AM PT and 4 PM ET / 1 PM PT, streaming live on YouTube, Facebook and Periscope.<br /><br />---<br />About “Salon Talks”<br />Hosted by Salon journalists, “Salon Talks” episodes offer a fresh take on the long-form interview format, and a much-needed break from the partisan political talking heads that have come to dominate the genre. “Salon Talks” is a destination for information through conversation.
