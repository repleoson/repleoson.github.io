{% raw %}Meet Anna Leikovic, a former model and social media star. If you’d followed her on Instagram, you’d think her life was great - poolside photos, expensive cars, high-end fashion and all the other common influencer tropes filled her feed portraying a glamorous lifestyle. But behind the scenes, Anna was hiding some big secrets from her mother, and when they came to light, it led to Anna being charged with something most people would not believe is possible.<br /><br />Some events just can't be explained, which is evident in many of the true crime documentaries out there. Not just the ones that are mainstream and everyone else has seen, but also the lesser-known titles and the overlooked gems. These incidents keep me perplexed unlike anything else can.<br /><br />For me, a true crime documentary is more than just leisure and enjoyment — it casts light upon the investigation and showcases its details to a whole new community of viewers that is eager for answers and justice. Not to mention, an in-depth true crime documentary can even lead to major breakthroughs. <br /><br />Welcome to Criminals &amp; Kittens, a brand new true crime series hosted by me, where I take a deep dive into some of the most fascinating, unbelievable true crime stories from around the world and present them to you with a fun twist. In this series, you will not only hear about crazy crime stories that actually happened, but you will also meet some really cute kittens. After you hear this story, if this true crime documentary doesn't send all sorts of chills running along your spine, nothing will.<br /><br />Series Concept by: Chills<br />Directed by: Chills<br />Produced by: Chills<br />Research and Scriptwriting by: Caillou Pettis &amp; Chills<br />Script Revisions by: Meagan Hall<br />Edited by: The Commodore Productions<br /><br />Chapters:<br />0:00 Introduction<br />1:21 Chapter 1: Aspirations of a Model<br />4:19 Chapter 2: Finding Success<br />5:45 Chapter 3: Anna’s Grudge<br />9:30 Chapter 4: Committing the Unthinkable<br />14:14 Chapter 5: Police Make A Startling Discovery<br />15:40 Chapter 6: Anna’s Bizarre Courtroom Behavior<br />19:06 Interlude: Kitty Fun Facts<br />20:56 Chapter 7: The Fate of Anna Leikovic<br /><br />#CriminalsAndKittens Episode 1{% endraw %}
