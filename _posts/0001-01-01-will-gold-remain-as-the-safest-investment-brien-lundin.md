{% raw %}&quot;The End of the Gold Standard in 1971, lost 85% of its value relative to the consumer price index&quot; Brien Lundin<br /><br /><br />It’s been 50 years since Richard Nixon decoupled gold from its price fix to the U.S. dollar, and now, monetary regimes need a return to a gold anchor more than ever in order to restore stability and credibility, said Brien Lundin, executive editor of the Gold Newsletter and host of the New Orleans Investment Conference. <br /><br />Lundin made the case that the U.S. dollar has, since the end of the Gold Standard in 1971, lost 85% of its value relative to the consumer price index, which he said may even be understating inflation, and that another dollar peg to gold may be what’s needed to prevent further devaluation.<br /><br />#gold #goldprice #silver #silverprice<br /><br />00:00 – A Return to the Gold Standard?<br />02:50 – Long-term outlook for gold <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Looking How To Make Money ?
