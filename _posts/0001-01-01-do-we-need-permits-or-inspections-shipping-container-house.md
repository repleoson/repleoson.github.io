{% raw %}This week was another huge week for us. When we thought we were going to be on hold we decided to just start a completely new project and oh my I am so glad we did. Do we have permits and inspections? Cody talks about everything we have to do to so we can get in our home! Things are moving along quickly and we are so thankful. Thank yall for the endless love and support.{% endraw %}
