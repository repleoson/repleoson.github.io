{% raw %}Strength, ductility and toughness are three very important, closely related material properties. The yield and ultimate strengths tell us how much stress a material can withstand, and are often used to define failure.<br /><br />Ductility tells us how much plastic deformation a material undergoes before fracture.  Brittle materials fracture at very small strains, and can fail catastrophically.<br /><br />Toughness tells us how much energy a material can absorb before fracture. It is closely linked to both strength and ductility.<br /><br />The Efficient Engineer is a channel aimed at mechanical and civil engineers. The mission is to simplify engineering concepts, one video at a time!<br /><br />---<br /><br />Follow me on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/efficiengineer">https://twitter.com/efficiengineer</a><br />Support the channel on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/efficientengineer">https://www.patreon.com/efficientengineer</a>{% endraw %}
