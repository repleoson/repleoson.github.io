{% raw %}Hi friends!<br /><br />In this video, we look at how to add additional tonalist layers to your oil painting. We will use liquin as a base layer to make the canvas slick and to help with the drying time of the oil paint.<br />We will rework some old clouds and make them into something a lot more interesting and visually appealing. <br />I ended up piddling with this painting after I turned the camera off and added some Prussian blue to the lower shadow area. Check it out my Instagram for the final image. <br />This technique is for beginner oil painters but even those who have a bit more experience may still benefit from watching this tonalist oil painting demo.<br />Thanks for watching and please subscribe and share this with someone who you think might benefit from these fundamentals.<br />Leave a question for me in the comments and I will try to address that.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />See you next time!<br />Kendall{% endraw %}
