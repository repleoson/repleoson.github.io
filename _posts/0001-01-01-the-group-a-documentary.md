Ostensibly aimed at helping young people overcome drug addiction, all evidence points to an organization that aims for profits and operates on a cult-like mentality.<br /><br />This organization, while claiming to have rescued thousands of teens from the horrors of drug addiction, has been repeatedly accused of using cult-like practices to control its teenage followers and their concerned families. <br /><br />The Group is a feature-length documentary that retraces the director's five year journey through the world of adolescent drug abuse programs. Through interviews with former members, archival photographs and expert witnesses, The Group tells the often personal story of the young people affected by the organization, their struggles with addiction and life after The Group.{% endraw %}
