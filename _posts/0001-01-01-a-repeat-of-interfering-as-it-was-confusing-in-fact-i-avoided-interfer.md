{% raw %}A better description is that everything affects everyting else. In this case working with the hatch in the forward hatch lead to that I changed the angle of the rudder axis. The video shows the effect of negative and positive rudder axis. The traditional is good at large angle of heel. The other if you use that the rudder gives no steering force. The rudder force only lifts the back of the boat. Hope this will clear up confusion.{% endraw %}
