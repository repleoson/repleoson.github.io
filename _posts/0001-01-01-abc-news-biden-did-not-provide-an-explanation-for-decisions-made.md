We are working moms, single dads, Boomers, Millennials, and more. And while we each have unique backgrounds and experiences, we’re united by a shared goal to make America a better place — a nation where we are not defined by our limits, but by our potential.<br /><br />The Republican Conference is dedicated to providing freedom and opportunity for every American. Made up of members from across the country, our agenda includes:<br />Empowering Individuals<br />Getting Government Off Of Americans’ Backs<br />Keeping Our Country Safe At Home &amp; Strong Abroad<br />Securing Our Borders<br />Protecting All Human Life<br />Preserving Our Constitutional Rights<br />Cutting Taxes<br />Upholding The Principles And Values That Have Made America Great<br />In contrast to House Democrats, who are embracing socialism, and pushing radical, far-left policies, we’re fighting to keep America safe, prosperous and free. That’s why it’s more important than ever to stand up for our values, and we appreciate your support.<br /><br /><br />Here, you’ll find many voices united by a common purpose: to restore the American people’s rightful place at the center of our representative government.{% endraw %}
