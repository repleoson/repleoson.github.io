And we have gone through good and bad times.<br />But your unconditional love was always on my mind.<br />You've been there from the start for me.<br />And your loves always been true as can be.<br />I give my heart to you.<br />I give my heart, cause nothing can compare in this world to you.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br />Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
