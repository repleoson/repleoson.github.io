{% raw %}Walking is a totally free, easy exercise that requires little effort, and benefits not only your physical but also your mental well-being. If you’re looking for a simple yet very effective way of losing weight and improving your overall health, walking is something just for you. <br />People who are physically active throughout their life are much less prone to this disease than those who have a more sedentary lifestyle. And that’s because they have more volume in their hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for verbal memory and learning.   <br />A daily half-hour walk helps avoid serious problems, like coronary heart disease to name one, by lowering high blood pressure and cholesterol levels and improving blood circulation. Because of better-quality and deeper breathing, some symptoms associated with lung disease can show significant improvement thanks to walking. <br />Muscle tone and weight loss is also totally achievable through simple walking. Find your optimal pace, but don’t break out into a jog. This sort of speed walking is low impact and doesn’t require any recovery time, which means no sore muscles to keep you from getting out and walking the next day.<br />The Arthritis Foundation recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate walking a day to reduce pain, stiffness, and inflammation in the joints. Building strong bones will help you prevent osteoporosis and reduce bone loss. Walking contributes to better blood circulation within the spinal structures, pumping important nutrients into the soft tissues and improving posture and flexibility, both of which are vital for a healthy spine.<br />A group of researchers at Iowa State University worked with hundreds of college students. Walking changed their mood for the better, even though no one warned them it could do so.<br />If you still don’t feel motivated enough to start walking for your health, try joining a class or find a buddy who also wouldn’t mind getting all the benefits of walking. Another idea could be to hire a personal trainer.<br /><br />Music: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music">https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music</a><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS<br />Brain-boosting effect 0:45<br />Improved eyesight 1:44<br />Prevention of heart disease 2:47<br />Increased lung volume 3:14<br />Benefits for the pancreas 3:51<br />Improved digestion 4:23<br />Toned muscles 4:59<br />Sturdier bones and joints 5:45<br />Back pain relief 6:10<br />A calmer mind 7:04<br />Bonus: the FIT formula 8:00<br /><br />SUMMARY<br />-Walking prevents the early onset of dementia, reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and improves your overall mental well-being by reducing stress and releasing endorphins.<br />-Get on the road to improve vision and protect your eyes now from potential problems, such as glaucoma, in the future. <br />-Walking is no less effective than running when it comes to the prevention of heart disease and stroke.<br />-Walking is an aerobic exercise, which means that it increases oxygen flow in the bloodstream and helps eliminate toxins and waste, which is great for your lungs. <br />-Walking for exercise is a surprisingly more effective way to prevent diabetes than running is.<br />-Just half an hour of walking every day not only lowers the risk of developing colon cancer but also improves digestion and regulates bowel movements.<br />-Just 10,000 steps a day can be just as effective as a full-blown workout at the gym, especially if you add some intervals or uphill walking.<br />-Walking can provide more joint mobility, prevent the loss of bone density, and even reduce the risk of fractures.<br />-Walking is a real life-saver for those who experience back pain during more challenging high-impact exercises.<br />-Walking improves depression symptoms in patients with MDD, just imagine how easily it could help us cope with just feeling down or exhausted.<br />-Keep in mind the FIT formula.
