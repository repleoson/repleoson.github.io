{% raw %}This weekend the World Championships Bicycle riding on the road were organised in Flanders. And if you didn't know yet: we Belgians are absolutely obsessed with bicycles. If bicycles would be humans, half of our populations would be married to one. Ofcourse we had to go sniff the vibes in the flemish streets. Enjoy the video!<br /><br />THANKS FOR WATCHING ❤️<br /><br />merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://averagerob.com">https://averagerob.com</a><br />watch zaddy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/xx1MIwPLoCc">https://youtu.be/xx1MIwPLoCc</a><br />instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/averagerob">http://instagram.com/averagerob</a><br />edited by: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/milancools">https://www.instagram.com/milancools</a><br /><br />TAGS: uci, world championship, road world championship, julien alaphilippe, wout van aert, mathieu van der poel, jasper stuyven, remco evenepoel, belgian cycling, huldenberg, flanders, smeysberg, leuven, bicycle{% endraw %}
