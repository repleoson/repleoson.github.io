{% raw %}I was very pleasantly surprised by this kit! Nearly everything was great right out of the box.  Sounds pretty decent too! This is definitely a kit that I would recommend to someone who is just getting into the hobby and wants to learn how to build guitars.  It takes most of the guesswork out of building a guitar, and it's a great kit to practice your soldering and understanding of how the components work together.  It's also great for practicing fretwork, learning to make a low end guitar play and sound like a high end guitar!
