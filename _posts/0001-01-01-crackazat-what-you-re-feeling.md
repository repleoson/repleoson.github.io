{% raw %}Available Friday 8th July - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.zrecords.ltd.uk/new-releases">http://www.zrecords.ltd.uk/new-releases</a><br /><br />Originally from Bristol UK, Ben J Worrall aka Crackazat is a musician, producer and composer, with a formal background in jazz composition. Now relocated to Sweden, where he releases through the Local Talk label, his productions and remixes have been gaining support from Disclosure, Detroit Swindle, Homework.<br /><br />For his Period Works EP for ZR he searched the extensive catalogue of ZR accapella's and blended parts of them to create three slamming new productions.<br /><br />&quot;Universal Love&quot; hits the right balance between the classic house sound and Crackazat's trademark warm, jazzy take on electronic music. &quot;What You're Feeling&quot; heads into more classic piano house territory with low-slung disco beats, while &quot;Crystal Eyes&quot; goes for futuristic chords with funk led guitars over a big bass groove.<br /><br />DJ Reactions:<br /><br />Groove Armada - Great release, really musical, diggin’ these<br />The Reflex - Superb tracks, looking forward to giving them a spin<br />Opolopo - Crackazat is at it with the quality stuff again!<br />Moodymanc - Loving all these, great EP, thanks<br />Booker T - Heavyyy set of tunes, will support<br />Richard Earnshaw - Solid EP!
