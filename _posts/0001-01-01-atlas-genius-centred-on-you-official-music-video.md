For two years, they devoted their days to constructing their dream studio and spent their nights performing songs by The Police, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones at local pubs to pay the bills. &quot;We really got down and dirty with dry walling and literally laying the floorboards, and at the same time we were taking a couple of days a week to focus on writing songs,&quot; recalls Keith Jeffery, Atlas Genius's vocalist/guitarist. &quot;We had a lot of song ideas and it was important to us to have our own studio where we could experiment and hone in on our sound,&quot; adds brother and drummer, Michael Jeffery. The studio was designed and outfitted by the brothers with the help of their father (who comes from a music and engineering background). Once the studio was complete, the first song that Atlas Genius finished was a song called &quot;Trojans,&quot; which they wrote, recorded and produced in collaboration with their friend, keyboardist Darren Sell. After many weeks tweaking the song, Michael insisted that the song was ready to be heard outside of the studio walls. Within an hour, &quot;Trojans&quot; was on the Triple J Unearthed Website, SoundCloud, and for sale via TuneCore on iTunes, Amazon and Spotify worldwide.<br /><br />&quot;We had begun to think that music was a pipedream and we had all gone back to university to pursue more realistic careers,&quot; says Keith. &quot;We'd had such a long slog of playing late nights and working all day, and it felt like we didn't really have anything to show for it.&quot; But then, in the midst of cramming for their Fall 2011 semester final exams, Neon Gold discovered &quot;Trojans&quot; on the Triple J Unearthed Website and wrote a post praising &quot;Trojans&quot; as a song sure to &quot;invade your head, all dressed up in a clever disguise of earnest vocals riding a hooky riff.&quot; Checking the band's email account for the first time in over a month, the band found that dozens of record labels, publishers, lawyers, booking agents and management companies from all over the world had contacted them.<br /><br />&quot;We were trying to focus on school, but it was just impossible,&quot; recalls Keith. &quot;So we said, 'There's something going on here. Let's get back to the music.'&quot; The band added manager, Jonny Kaps from +1, to their extended family to navigate all of the interest as the band focused on writing and recording more songs.<br /><br />Quickly named an iTunes Single of the Week in Australia and New Zealand, &quot;Trojans&quot; reached #4 on Hype Machine by the end of May. In August, SiriusXM Satellite Radio's Alt-Nation discovered the song on a blog and decided to give it some spins. There was an immediate reaction from listeners, and in September, &quot;Trojans&quot; was placed into heavy rotation, where it maintained a top-five position on the listener-generated Alt-18 countdown and peaked at number one for 4 consecutive weeks in January 2012. &quot;Trojans&quot; began selling over a thousand tracks per week on U.S. iTunes and soon climbed to 45,000 sales - all with zero promotional efforts from the still-unsigned Atlas Genius.<br /><br />The band's first release from their new label home, the EP Through The Glass (produced, engineered and mixed by the band), came out in June of 2012. With Through The Glass completed, Atlas Genius then holed up in its studio and worked on writing and recording its first full-length album, while at the same time rehearsing for their first ever tour. The tour started in August 2012 and led to three more tours back to back taking them thru to the end of the year. Thus, their full-length debut was finished up between tour dates and got completed just before Christmas 2012. When It Was Now is set for a US release on February 19th, 2013, with an international release to follow soon after.{% endraw %}
