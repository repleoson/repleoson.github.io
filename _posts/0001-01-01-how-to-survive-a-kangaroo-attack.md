And how fast can they come after you? Between 1999 and 2002, kangaroos attacked at least 15 people. And those are just the attacks that got reported. Since then, there have been other attacks in different regions of Australia.  So if you find yourself face-to-face with a kangaroo and you want to survive, follow these steps.<br /><br />Questions or concerns?
