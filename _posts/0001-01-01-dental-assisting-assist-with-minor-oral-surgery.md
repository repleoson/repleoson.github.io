{% raw %}Dental Assisting - Assist with Minor Oral Surgery (excerpt)<br /><br />We are excited to bring to you our brand new suite of Dental Assisting education modules with web-based skills simulations. A first for dental education! <br /><br />This video is a tiny sneak peek into our Dental Assisting - Assist with Minor Oral Surgery module. Each module doesn't only have a video, but also contains a simulation where you can learn and practice the procedure interactively, step by step, then test your skills. On top of that you'll get an illustrated text description of the skill or procedure to read, a 3D model of relevant anatomy or equipment to explore, and a multi-choice quiz. All activity and scores are tracked in the logbook, so you can see your progress over time. <br /><br />You can find more information about all our DA modules here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.simtics.com/shop/dental-assisting">https://www.simtics.com/shop/dental-assisting</a><br /><br />SIMTICS is powered by SimTutor Inc.<br />SimTutor Inc creates simulation-based solutions to prepare students and professionals for mission-critical moments at the time they need these skills the most. <br />SimTutor offers two options: the SIMTICS library of over 175 simulated healthcare procedures, adopted by more than 350 schools across the US, and SimTutor Author, a software tool for creating life-like simulations and scenario-based eLearning.<br /><br />The SIMTICS modules include simulation, 3D anatomy, video and step-by-step text guidance, covering a wide range of content for medical assisting, dental assisting, sonography, radiography, and more.
