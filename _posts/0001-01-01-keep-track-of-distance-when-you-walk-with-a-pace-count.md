{% raw %}Keep track of distance when you walk with a Pace Count. What do you need? 100 Meter measuring tape is the way to go. I would recommend watching another Quick Tip from our series called DIY Ranger Beads. These in conjunction with the steps in this video will provide you with an excellent means of keeping track of distance, and should provide a very close estimate of distance over various terrain. The toughest part may be getting access to terrain that provides a flat, inclining and declining landscape. Once you have that, you are good to go.{% endraw %}
