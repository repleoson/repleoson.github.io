{% raw %}This is Part II of the Most Effective Way to Increase Your Glutathione Benefits. It was created in response to the question of why has there been such a dramatic increase in chronic disease in western countries, notoriously the US is leading the way. Many people watching this video want to jump out and buy various supplements for themselves or others to support their glutathione production. That's a great idea if they have a need to if they are deficient in it or have an inflammatory condition (as covered in this video) but it is NOT a great idea if you don't. <br /><br />Consider reducing your cause of oxidative stress from high omega 6 diet that you have previously been unaware of and go get tested to determine your actual numbers. Your data is extraordinarily important for you, your understanding and will help you mark your improvement if and when you do choose to start NAC or any one of the glutathione supplements... and if will no doubt save you money as well.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This video is not meant to diagnose, treat, or mitigate any medical condition. It is merely for personal educational use only.<br />WATCH NEXT:<br />How to increase your NAC / Glutathione Part I   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/SChxMSzxKAo">https://youtu.be/SChxMSzxKAo</a><br /><br />STUDIES MENTIONED IN THE VIDEO:<br />An Increase in the Omega-6/Omega-3 Fatty Acid Ratio Increases the Risk for Obesity 2016<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808858/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808858/</a><br /><br /><br />Long-Chain ω-3 Fatty Acids for Indicated Prevention of Psychotic Disorders 2009 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/210554">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/210554</a><br /><br />—————————COME SAY HI!!!  ——————————<br />Podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/482971/episodes">https://www.buzzsprout.com/482971/episodes</a><br />Facebook Group about Keto: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ketonaturopath/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/ketonaturopath/</a><br />BLOG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ketonaturopath.com/">https://ketonaturopath.com/</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/ketonaturopath">https://www.pinterest.com/ketonaturopath</a><br />YouTube channel<br />www.youtube.com/ketonaturopath<br />Free Keto Food List: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ketonaturopath.ac-page.com/keto-food-list-optin">https://ketonaturopath.ac-page.com/keto-food-list-optin</a><br /><br />———————————  OUR COURSE ——————————<br />PSMF 30 day course: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebiointegrationcode.com/courses/PSMFChallenge">https://www.thebiointegrationcode.com/courses/PSMFChallenge</a><br />———————————  WHERE WE GET OUR WINE (an affiliate link) ——————————<br /><br /><br /><br />Dry farm wines<br />www.dryfarmwines.com/ketonaturopath<br />————————-   THE KETOMETER WE USE  ————————————————<br /><br /><br />Keto mojo<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.keto-mojo.com/?rfsn=3712430.393b9c&amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=3712430.393b9c">https://shop.keto-mojo.com/?rfsn=3712430.393b9c&amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=3712430.393b9c</a><br /><br /><br /><br />————————————Where you can get your labs done——————————————<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.UltaLabTests.com/ketonaturopath">https://www.UltaLabTests.com/ketonaturopath</a><br /><br /><br /><br />————————————  WHERE WE BUY OUR SUPPLEMENTS  ————————————<br />Wellevate: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wellevate.me/karl-goldkamp">https://wellevate.me/karl-goldkamp</a> <br />  or call them: 855-935-5382<br />How to use Wellevate <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/1ulC0LLIc5c">https://youtu.be/1ulC0LLIc5c</a><br /><br />Why get a Wellevate account to get your supplements??<br />1.
