{% raw %}Too often, we base our value on how somebody is treating us, how successful we are, or how perfectly we have lived our life. The problem is that all of those things can change. Joel wants to show you how your value doesn’t come from people or things; it comes from your Creator.<br /><br />You may feel average today, but 1 John 4:4 says, “You belong to God.” You are extremely valuable! Learn to recognize your value in who God made you to be and how He sees you. You are a child of the Most High God! This message will give you a fresh, new confidence in who God made you to be.<br /><br />This is Message #724 “Recognizing Your Value“ by Joel Osteen.
