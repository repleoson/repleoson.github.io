In cities like Auckland, where the average house price is over 1 million dollars and climbing fast, many see their dreams of home ownership moving further from reality. <br /><br />Thankfully, with a little creative thinking, there are still ways to get started on the housing ladder and this innovative young couple decided to get out of the rent trap by purchasing a pre-loved tiny house so they could start paying off their own home and begin saving money to purchase land. <br /><br />Their tiny home is incredibly clever in its design. It’s spacious, with more than enough room for the couple and with an abundance of storage. Throughout the home there are super clever design features, such as the innovative office loft, and ultra clever pull-out stairs. The entire centre floor of this home opens up into an abundance of additional storage space, and dual french doors ensure the home has an abundance of light and connection to the outdoors. <br /><br />Nicola and Arron have big dreams for their future and plan on one day living on a stunning sustainable property surrounded by fruit trees. Every month they purchase a new fruit tree together a a reminder of the dreams they share and the goals they are working towards. This tiny house is an essential part of that, as they are now able to live in their own home which will soon be paid off and enable them to begin saving for land. <br /><br />Enjoy the video tour of this very special home!
