{% raw %}Pegasus spyware is capable of bypassing your phone's security and gaining complete access to your device - including emails, messages, GPS location, photos, video, and your phone's microphone. A Guardian investigation can now reveal widespread abuse of the Pegasus technology by government clients around the world who purchased the spyware from its Israeli manufacturer — the NSO Group. People who were selected as possible targets include journalists, lawyers and human rights defenders.<br /><br />Subscribe to The Guardian on YouTube ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://is.gd/subscribeguardian">http://is.gd/subscribeguardian</a><br /><br />The Pegasus Project ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/pegasus-project">https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/pegasus-project</a><br /><br />The Guardian publishes independent journalism, made possible by supporters.
