{% raw %}Intelligent Parking tracker |  Using computer vision methods to detect cars and vacant spaces<br /><br />My very first computer vision project titled, &quot;Detecting vacant spaces in a car parking&quot;. Detects cars in a parking where camera is placed at lamp-post angle. Code on my git: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/ankit1khare/Automatic-Parking-Management.">https://github.com/ankit1khare/Automatic-Parking-Management.</a> I would be happy if someone wants to contribute and make the code better.<br /><br />Automatic Parking Detection 2 is my upcoming tutorial which will use a deep neural network classifier for better accuracy. You can also read my article &quot;Easy street parking&quot; on my GitHub and make contributions into it.{% endraw %}
