The band originated out of an innate need for music that meets people exactly where they are, providing an immediate, pure and energetic release from the everyday routine. Jesse Selengut, composer, lead vocalist and trumpet player first felt drawn to create Tin Pan after witnessing how his uninhibited style of performance differed from typical jazz presentations—his had the power to astonish and enrapture audiences with the kind of gusto previously reserved for rock n’ roll shows. Once that seed was planted, there was no question that the project would thrive.<br />----<br />Don's Tunes on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/dondraperstunes/">https://www.facebook.com/dondraperstunes/</a><br />Don's Tunes on Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/ENqKEE">https://goo.gl/ENqKEE</a><br />#Blues &amp; Jazz Group: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/72sLfA">https://goo.gl/72sLfA</a><br />Don's Tunes on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mr.don.draper/">https://www.instagram.com/mr.don.draper/</a><br />Don's Tunes on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DonsTunes">https://twitter.com/DonsTunes</a>{% endraw %}
