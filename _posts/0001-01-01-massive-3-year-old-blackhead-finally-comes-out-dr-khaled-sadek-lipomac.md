These are common and are known commonly on the face and back. They are removed from our cyst removal clinic in London. <br /><br />An epidermoid cyst is a non-cancerous growth commonly found on the skin of the face or neck, but can occur anywhere on the body. Just as its name suggests, these cysts occur as a result of epidermal cells, cells from the top layer of your skin a.k.a the epidermis, overgrow in a confined space. The buildup of these cells under the skin results in a “cheesy” consistency and often a pungent odor! Epidermoid cysts  are typically harmless and have no symptoms, but people often seek removal due to the appearance of the bump or because the cyst has become inflamed or ruptured. If you have a ruptured cyst you may notice, sudden redness, pain, swelling, and heat around the area, all of which can lead to an abscess forming. Surgically removing the cyst can cure the area, but the entire cyst sac and all of its contents need to be removed to ensure the cyst won’t grow back! <br /><br />If you would like more information then email us on<br />ksadek@thesmartclinics.co.uk<br /><br />www.lipomacyst.com<br /><br /><br />NEW HEALTH CHANNEL<br />Dr Khaled Sadek : Uncut<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeVuAd4g2Br5W_Fgi_H6D8w">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeVuAd4g2Br5W_Fgi_H6D8w</a>{% endraw %}
