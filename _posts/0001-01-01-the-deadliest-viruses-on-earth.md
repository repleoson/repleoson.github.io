{% raw %}Did you know that there are more than 320,000 viruses that can infect mammals? One of the most talked-about viruses nowadays is SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, but it is not the deadliest. There are other even more lethal viruses that are the stuff of nightmares.<br /><br />This might leave you wondering where these viruses come from and how they can kill you. In our video, we explore all these questions and bring you a specific list of the deadliest viruses. The candidates on that list may surprise you.<br /><br />For instance, rabies is one of the most dangerous viruses around. The virus causes about 56,000 deaths per year in more than 95 percent of Africa and Asia. <br /><br />It is mostly transmitted from domestic dogs, but bats and rats also play a minor role. One bite from an infected animal can result in inflammation of the brain, nausea, vomiting, violent movements, and even a fear of water. <br /><br />By then, it’s too late for the infected individual, and death typically occurs after a few days due to cardio-respiratory arrest.<br /><br />Rabies is only one of the most lethal viruses on Earth right now. If you're curious about our other picks and how they affect humans, watch our video to find out more.<br /><br />To get the latest science and technology news, subscribe to our newsletter “The Blueprint” at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3BDdN5e">https://bit.ly/3BDdN5e</a><br /><br />Find out more information at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3dsZsza">https://bit.ly/3dsZsza</a><br /><br />#engineering{% endraw %}
