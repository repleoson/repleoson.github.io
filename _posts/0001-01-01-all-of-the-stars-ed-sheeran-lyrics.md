{% raw %}&quot;All Of The Stars&quot; by Ed Sheeran ✨<br />Soundtrack from the movie &quot;The Fault In Our Stars&quot;<br />_______________<br /><br /> Lyrics:<br /><br /> It's just another night<br /> And I'm staring at the moon<br /> I saw a shooting star<br /> And thought of you<br /> I sang a lullaby<br /> By the waterside and knew<br /> If you were here,<br /> I'd sing to you<br /> You're on the other side<br /> As the skyline splits in two<br /> I'm miles away from seeing you<br /> I can see the stars<br /> From America<br /> I wonder, do you see them, too?<br /><br /> So open your eyes and see<br /> The way our horizons meet<br /> And all of the lights will lead<br /> Into the night with me<br /> And I know these scars will bleed<br /> But both of our hearts believe<br /> All of these stars will guide us home<br /><br /> I can hear your heart<br /> On the radio beat<br /> They're playing 'Chasing Cars'<br /> And I thought of us<br /> Back to the time,<br /> You were lying next to me<br /> I looked across and fell in love<br /> So I took your hand<br /> Back through lamp lit streets I knew<br /> Everything led back to you<br /> So can you see the stars?<br /> Over Amsterdam<br /> You're the song my heart is<br /> Beating to<br /><br /> So open your eyes and see<br /> The way our horizons meet<br /> And all of the lights will lead<br /> Into the night with me<br /> And I know these scars will bleed<br /> But both of our hearts believe<br /> All of these stars will guide us home<br /><br /> And, oh, I know<br /> And oh, I know, oh<br /><br /> I can see the stars<br /> From America<br /> _______________<br /><br /> Daumen hoch, wenn ich jetzt öfters Lyrics-Videos hochladen soll ❤️{% endraw %}
