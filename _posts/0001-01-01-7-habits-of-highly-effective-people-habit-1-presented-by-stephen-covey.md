{% raw %}&quot;The proactive approach to a mistake is to acknowledge it instantly, correct and learn from it.&quot; - DR. STEPHEN R. COVEY<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://serenemedia.co.uk/">https://serenemedia.co.uk/</a><br /><br />Habit 1:   Be Proactive is about taking responsibility for your life. You can't keep blaming everything on your parents or grandparents. <br /><br />Proactive people recognize that they are &quot;response-able.&quot; They don't blame genetics, circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior. They know they choose their behavior. <br /><br />Reactive people, on the other hand, are often affected by their physical environment. They find external sources to blame for their behavior. If the weather is good, they feel good. If it isn't, it affects their attitude and performance, and they blame the weather.<br /><br />“I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.”<br /><br />DR. STEPHEN R. COVEY{% endraw %}
