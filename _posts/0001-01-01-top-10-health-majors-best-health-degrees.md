I've make videos about that in the past and will into the future<br />2) This is a personal finance channel, so I talk about things related to finances on this channel<br /><br />Enjoy,<br />~Shane<br /><br />These videos are for entertainment purposes only and they are just Shane's opinion based off of his own life experience and the research that he's done.
