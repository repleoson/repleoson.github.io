Since the 1950s, his work involved trying to uncover human thinking processes and replicate them in machines. [Listener: Christopher Sykes; date recorded: 2011]<br /><br />TRANSCRIPT: I went back to Harvard from '54 to '57 for three years as part of this so-called Society of Fellows, and again that was a little community, but they were... each person was in a different field, pretty much, so it was like a Rotary Club; and there were poets like Donald Hall and John Hollander, two friends, and there was the junior Fellows at the time I was there... what’s his name, the Ant Man?<br /><br />[CS] EO Wilson.<br /><br />Yep. Ed Wilson was there some of the time – most of the time he would be in a little telephone booth in some jungle watching some animals – and there was Noam Chomsky, who was making his terrible theories about language at the time.{% endraw %}
