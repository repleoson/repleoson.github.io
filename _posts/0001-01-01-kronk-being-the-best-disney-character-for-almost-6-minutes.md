{% raw %}I really did not expect my Cinderella 3 vid to do that well so I’m gonna do the same thing, BUT BETTER! Thank you guys for blowing it up btw, y’all are too kind. <br /><br />But yeah, Kronk is bae, Kronk is a bro, Kronk is the goat, Kronk is the best Disney character PERIODT! I’m planning on doing a part since there were too many good moments that couldn’t fit into this vid, soooo yeah.{% endraw %}
