{% raw %}The SGC is surprised by a visit from Thor, who tells them that the time of the Asgard has come to an end and he is going to transfer all of their knowledge and technology to humans. The information has barely been received when the Odyssey is attacked by the Ori. They are out-gunned and the only way to keep from being destroyed is to put the ship in a time dilation bubble where time inside the ship seemingly passes normally but where time outside the bubble might be only a few seconds. Sam hopes the time will allow her to explore the new technologies they've received and find a way out of their dilemma. Years pass however with new relationships being formed and with an ever rising sense of helplessness.{% endraw %}
