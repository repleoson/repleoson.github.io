{% raw %}Try it out for yourself at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://processkit.com">https://processkit.com</a><br /><br />In this video I showed a &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; of my reworking of the single project view layout.<br /><br />It went from a single-page-layout to a multi-tabbed view.
