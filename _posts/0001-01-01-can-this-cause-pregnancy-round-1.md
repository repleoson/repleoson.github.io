{% raw %}There are TONS of ways to be intimate with a partner, but only a few ways that cause pregnancy. However, the possibility of pregnancy can be a scary concept for a young couple exploring their sexuality. I'm responding to some of your scenarios about intimacy and sharing whether or not pregnancy COULD be a possibility. On this episode:<br /><br />*Can you get pregnant from dry humping?<br />*Can you get pregnant after naked foreplay?<br />*Can I get pregnant from sitting on my boyfriend's lap? Naked?<br />*My period is really late but the pregnancy test was negative. Could I still be pregnant?<br />*Can I get pregnant from semen outside my vagina?<br /><br />And if you want to ask your own question, reply to this video or submit anonymously at www.AskDoctorT.net!{% endraw %}
