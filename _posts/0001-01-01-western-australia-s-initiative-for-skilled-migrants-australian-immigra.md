{% raw %}Do you know that the Government of Western Australia is executing the ideas of the Skills Summit?<br /><br />Need an Expert Consultation Session to discuss immigration/work visa/Study Visa Queries: Online Consultation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.a2zimmi.com/consultation/">http://www.a2zimmi.com/consultation/</a> Contact us at: +91-9877456409 | +91-6283962009<br /><br />Now Let us know which ideas are being brought into action by the McGowan Government of Western Australia.<br /><br />• New post-summit initiatives to support Western Australia's skilled worker needs<br />• 100 places for local mature-age apprentices brought forward<br />• Work underway to attract up to 5,000 onshore skilled migrants from interstate to WA<br />• State Government's multibillion dollar infrastructure program will be reviewed with a view to smoothing pipeline of work to ease workforce pressures<br />• Targeted advertising campaign to attract interstate and New Zealand skilled workers and increase participation of under-represented groups in WA<br />• Boost to Aboriginal youth employment opportunities and enhanced support for jobseekers to obtain driver's licenses<br />• Regional Skills Summits set to take place throughout WA <br /><br />The McGowan Labor Government is moving quickly to implement proposals identified at last Friday's Skills Summit in collaboration with Western Australian industry leaders. As part of its ongoing cooperation with business and training providers to address the State's skilled worker shortage, the State Government today announced new priority initiatives to attract and retain skilled employees in Western Australia.<br /><br />These key initiatives are immediate actions the State Government will take to bolster the State's workforce, while work is undertaken to convert concepts from the summit into additional initiatives.<br /><br /> The State Government has brought forward the next 100 spaces from 2022-23, following the extraordinary success of the Jobs and Skills WA Adult Apprentice Employer Incentive, which reached its 100-place quota in just over two weeks.<br /><br />This ensures employers will immediately be eligible for the adult apprentice financial incentive - up to $26,800. The State Government is requesting an additional 5,000 onshore slots from the Commonwealth Government under the State Nominated Migration Program, citing onshore visa holders' significant interest in filling skilled jobs in WA.<br /><br />Thousands of skilled onshore migrants living interstate have expressed interest in working in WA after the scheme was expanded to include 134 occupations last month. Following detailed consultation with industry, the State Government's multibillion dollar infrastructure program will be reviewed to smooth the pipeline of work to ease workforce pressures across the economy.<br /><br />As part of the 2021-22 State Budget, the McGowan Administration's Asset Investment Program will be reviewed. A focused advertising strategy will also be devised to attract interstate and New Zealand workers, as well as improve involvement of under-represented groups in Western Australia. The state government will continue to collaborate with the private sector to identify priority areas and market opportunities.<br /><br />A new relationship with the Wirrpanda Foundation will provide targeted assistance to Aboriginal job seekers aged 15 to 24, addressing specific hurdles to employment. The State Government will also implement programs to assist underprivileged learner drivers in obtaining a driver's license, which is a major obstacle to employment for many.<br /><br />The State Government will also conduct a series of targeted Regional Skills Summits across WA in the next five months, due to regional WA's particular difficulties. Premier Mark McGowan, Education, and Training Minister Sue Ellery, Cabinet members, and business executives from a variety of sectors were among the more than 130 people who attended the Skills Summit.<br /><br />Premier Mark McGowan is reported as saying: &quot;The Skills Summit provided a tremendous opportunity for government and industry to collaborate on immediate workforce concerns to sustain our booming economy, while also reinforcing our commitment to local training and jobs.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Get the best app for the latest immigration news and immigration calculator tools: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...">https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...</a> <br /><br />Our Social Links: YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/A2zImmI/">https://www.youtube.com/c/A2zImmI/</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Immigration....">https://www.facebook.com/Immigration....</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/a2zimmi">https://twitter.com/a2zimmi</a> <br />Source of information: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3fEFG58">https://bit.ly/3fEFG58</a><br /><br />#Australianskilledmigration #Skilledimmigrationvisa #Australiavisaupdates2021 #Australianimmigrationupdates #Australianvisa #Skilledmigration{% endraw %}
