{% raw %}I took one of BAâ€™s A380 â€˜Pilot Refresherâ€™ flights across to Frankfurt for a Member Show in November as they were preparing their crews for the return to Long-haul service. Iâ€™ve taken the Liberty of giving her a title of â€˜Luxury Linerâ€™ and yes, I know the AA DC10â€™s were first with the name, but apart from the new comfy Big twins, I think this Big Mega Jet deserves the title. Sitting in this thing, even the Economy seats, is like getting a ride in a Rolls Royce: big wide comfy seats and comfy arm rests. <br />We were all on the lower deck, very few pax onboard, which was a delight and really did testament to the quietness of the cabin. <br />If you like to look out the window and want to see land below as well as a great shot of the Wing and the flight surfaces at work, then I suggest seat â€˜Aâ€™ row 36, 37, 38 or 39. Or the other side depending on your preference, or neck strength - I do a lot of looking ðŸ˜„<br />Anyhoo, enjoy this short flight from London Heathrow to Frankfurt. Check out the 600ft visibility landing at FRA!!!<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />To enjoy exclusive Member Only chat and content, checkout my 3-Tier Channel Membership and join us on International trips as well as Airside and Feature Shows.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkQef3Fidr7tm3gNuXgGKPw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkQef3Fidr7tm3gNuXgGKPw/join</a><br /><br /><br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br /><br />You can read all about Big Jet TV and how we put your money to work at www.bigjet.tv{% endraw %}
