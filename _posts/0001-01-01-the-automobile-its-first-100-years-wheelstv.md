{% raw %}Produced by Mercedes-Benz North America in 1986, 'The Automobile the First 100 Years' takes a Historical look at the evolution of the Automobile and the Automobile Culture. <br /><br />As some have pointed out in the comments, Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot actually created the first known &quot;mechanical land vehicle&quot; back in 1770. They don't mention him, but you do see a drawing of his 1770 fardier Ã  vapeur in the opening sequence.{% endraw %}
