{% raw %}want to make the inner part of your THIGHS less wobbly? I know, it's a problem area for many of us - let's do something about it! ♥︎ /  Werbung <br /><br />If you don't have a proper weight, don't worry! Read my &quot;homemade weight tutorial&quot; below ♥︎<br /> <br />This workout: <br />- strengthens your legs<br />- main focus: inner thighs. That's why we do SUMO Squats and not regular ones, etc. :)<br />- will make your muscles look more toned &amp; less &quot;flabby&quot; <br />- second focus: booty &amp; front of the thighs <br /><br />Things to make sure: <br />▸ bodyweight focusses on your HEELS, don't shift your bodyweight onto your toes <br />▸ your BACK stays STRAIGHT. Don't round it! <br />▸ keep your KNEES stable. Never collapse them inwards, rather push them a bit outwards<br /><br />__<br /><br />▸ I am using a 5kg / 11 lbs dumbbell. Please choose a weight that feels good for you. <br />Weights help us to increase the intensity of a workout &amp; build stronger muscles! <br /><br />Your home-made weight: <br />1. Take a bag <br />2. Search for dense + heavy food at home. For example: packs of rice, books, etc. <br />3. You can easily put 4 to 8 things into one bag. That can make 3 to 6 kg :) <br /><br />__<br /><br />▸ you can find FREE WORKOUT PLANS on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations.
