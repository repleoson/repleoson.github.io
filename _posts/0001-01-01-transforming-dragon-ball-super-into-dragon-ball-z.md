But have you thought about how the artstyle and colours play into the vibe? Myself, Editor San, Anime Ajay and Trev are gonna transform some of Super's best artwork into the style of Dragon Ball Z's best. <br /><br />We will be changing some Goku's, Freeza's, Gohan and Ultra Instinct. I'm very excited to share this with you! This might not be Dragon ball Z but it's Dragon Ball Super perhaps how it might have looked had the circumstances been different :) <br /><br />TREV'S TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/IamTheTrev">https://twitter.com/IamTheTrev</a><br /><br />AJAY'S TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AnimeAjay">https://twitter.com/AnimeAjay</a><br />AJAY'S YT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AjayLikesGaming">https://www.youtube.com/user/AjayLikesGaming</a><br /><br />MUSIC:<br /><br />-Rock the Dragon (Cover by Abraham Castaneda)<br />-Prologue (DBZ)<br />-Dragon Ball FighterZ Opening<br />-Character Select (Gunvolt 2)<br />-M1206 (DBZ)<br />-M1212 (DBZ)<br />-M919 (DBZ)<br />-Hit’s Theme (DB FighterZ)<br />-Dance of Deduction (Great Ace Attorney)<br />-Goku Black (Pokemixr92 Remix)<br />-Desperate Assault (Pokemixr92)<br />-Fused Zamazu (Custom Score by Pokemixr92)<br />-Super Saiyan Caulifla (Pokemixr92)<br />-Ultra Instinct (Pokemixr92)<br />-M1604 (DBZ)<br /><br />————————————        <br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/TotallyNotMark">https://www.twitter.com/TotallyNotMark</a><br /><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/TotallyNotMark">https://www.instagram.com/TotallyNotMark</a><br /><br />PATREON: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TotallyNotMark">https://www.patreon.com/TotallyNotMark</a><br />————————————<br /><br />EDITOR-SAN: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtWGnAt3J3_sdAJpncwkv9w/">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtWGnAt3J3_sdAJpncwkv9w/</a>{% endraw %}
