{% raw %}The Military Diet is a super effective short-term food plan that claims to help you lose up to ten pounds in a week. What’s even better, you don’t have to workout and get to eat hotdogs and ice cream. <br />One of the coolest things about this diet is that it lasts only 3 days. You can achieve impressive results only if you follow the eating plan to a T.<br />This diet is surprisingly really easy to follow and doesn’t demand much on your part. You don’t need to constantly count calories, spend hours at the gym, or buy a long list of really expensive supplements. The Military Diet calls for ingredients you can easily find at your nearest grocery store. <br />And how exactly does it work? No miracles, just pure metabolism kick-starting. By decreasing your calorie intake over a short period, your body will burn more fat and, as a result, you’ll lose weight effortlessly. It’s definitely not your typical starvation diet. While it is low in calories, it provides you with the energy you need to have a productive day since it includes healthy fats, carbohydrates, and protein.<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS<br />How does it work? 1:15<br />Day 1 1:46<br />Day 2 2:42<br />Day 3 3:40<br />Additional tips 4:46<br /><br />SUMMARY<br />-By decreasing your calorie intake over a short period, your body will burn more fat and, as a result, you’ll lose weight effortlessly.<br />-Start your day with a cup of coffee or tea, a toast with peanut butter and half a grapefruit.
