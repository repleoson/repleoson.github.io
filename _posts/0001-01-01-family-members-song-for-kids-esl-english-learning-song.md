It starts out slow and goes faster and faster. It gives many opportunities for students to lean and review.<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />Lyrics:<br /><br />This is my great family.<br />Mother, father, me.<br /><br />This is my great family.<br />Mother, father, me.<br /><br />This is my sister.<br />This is my brother.<br />Grandmother, grandfather, aunt, uncle, cousin.<br /><br />This is my great family.<br />Mother, father, me.<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />Additional Teaching Ideas:<br /><br />1. For a fun activity, have students think of actions they can do to represent each family member (example: mother could be an action or rocking a baby. Grandfather could be an action of walking with a cane). When the students sing the song, they can act out each action. This gets especially fun at the end of the song when it goes very fast.<br /><br />2. Pause the video in the middle and point to a family member. Have the students shout out who the family member is.<br /><br />3. Pause the video in the middle and have a student go to the front of the class. Say a family member and have them point to the correct family member.<br /><br />4. Have the students practice writing down the names of each family member five times.<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />Music:<br /><br />This song is to the tune of &quot;Old McDonald.&quot;<br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.superenglishkid.com/">http://www.superenglishkid.com/</a> for free games, activities, worksheets, and more English teaching ideas!{% endraw %}
