{% raw %}Learn how to run a 5-1 volleyball rotation (both serve receive and service rotations) and learn what the concept of base positions on defense is.<br /><br />NOTE: Liberos CAN serve in the US, but in most other countries they can't! I should have clarified that in the video. If you are living outside the US, the libero should not serve but instead the middle blocker should serve!<br /><br />Watch my other video on how to run a 6-2 rotation here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/b48Y9BhVsSs">https://youtu.be/b48Y9BhVsSs</a>{% endraw %}
