I'm wearing our bamboo meridian beanie that has gathered sides and light padding on the top to provide extra volume underneath our headscarf and help prevent it from slipping.  Today I'm using our 100% cotton woodblock headscarf and to start off we're going to take two opposite corners and fold it to make a triangle. The triangle is  the basis of most ways to tie your square headscarf. Now we're going to take the folded side of the triangle and place it along the hairline. Once you do that the tail of the triangle will be pointed towards the ground and you're going to take the long sides and tie them in a knot. Now that you have the initial knot you're going to want to adjust it over the ears to make sure you have full head coverage. We now have 2 different ways to tie the scarf. We can tie it in a square knot and you can just loop it around again and tie it in a knot. And this is the first way to tie your headscarf. To create our second look, we're once again going to take our corners together to create the same triangle and place the folded edge against our hairline again. Take your two long ends and tie a simple knot, now we're going to tie a bow and it sounds complicated but it's just like tying your shoes. And this is our second look. To give a more elegant look, what I've done is taken the tied bow and twisted it over to the side and you can also do this with the square knot too. And this is the classic way to tie our square headscarf.{% endraw %}
