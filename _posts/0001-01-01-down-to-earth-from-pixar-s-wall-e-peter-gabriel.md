{% raw %}Unofficial music video for the credits song of Disney Pixar's 2008 film WALL•E, as sung by Peter Gabriel. <br /><br />I created this video primarily using clips from WALL•E, but I also included shots from the BBC's documentary series Planet Earth, a brief clip from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, one clip from the Pixar short Burn•E (have fun finding that clip), footage of an early Wright brothers flight in 1903, audio from the first moon landing just 66 years later, and a clip from an EPI video about the destination of our trash: the landfill. I have links to the two YouTube videos I used later on in this description.<br /><br />Of course, I do not own the copyright to any of those works, they belong to their respective owners or are in the public domain. No copyright infringement is intended, as I do not wish to make profit off this video and was a mere labor of love.<br /><br />I actually created an earlier music video back in 2010 in standard definition. If you would like to compare this current, far superior, version to the original, just go here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLl735Nr9lU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLl735Nr9lU</a><br /><br />Wright Brothers First Flight (1903): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/Wfyvspnko04">http://youtu.be/Wfyvspnko04</a><br />Trash Disposal Journey Into A Landfill: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/zjFBrRcTfic">http://youtu.be/zjFBrRcTfic</a> (no longer available sadly){% endraw %}
