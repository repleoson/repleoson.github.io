{% raw %}Hello Everyone ! Thank you so much for the 1 million views! and I really hope that this video led you to read more about these people who shaped our history.<br /><br /> I wanted to make a video that showcases the most influential people who played a role in shaping the world. Their actions influenced our views on the world today . <br /><br />I selected this list by Micheal H.Hart(An American author) after reading his book &quot;The 100&quot; it was an interesting ranking with many names that impacted our world .<br /><br />I tried to give a brief synopsis about everyone on this list. What they're famous for, their greatest achievements, or their main role in a certain field. At the end of the day , the goal of the video is to spread knowledge and help educate. I hope that you learned something new. Even if we agree or disagree about this list . And i quote : <br /><br />“Numerous times throughout history, a single person has made a tremendous impact on the world. I don’t know why anyone would think that can’t still happen.”<br />― Richelle E. Goodrich, Slaying Dragons: Quotes, Poetry, &amp; a few Short Stories for Every Day of the Year     <br /><br />..............................................................................................................................................<br />100 most influential people in the world <br /><br />100 most influential This is a list chosen by Michael H. Hart, from the book ‘100 most influential people in the world’. He chose people on a ranking of who had done the most to influence the world. I recommend reading the book as it offers an interesting insight into the influence of different individuals. As the author notes, ‘Influential’ does not include a judgement on whether they influenced the world for the better or worse.<br /><br />Source &amp; more reading : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biographyonline.net/people/100-most-influential.html">https://www.biographyonline.net/people/100-most-influential.html</a><br /><br /><br />Music : kevin macleod ~ hero down{% endraw %}
