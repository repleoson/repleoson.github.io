Popular television shows, such as CBS's Numbers, regularly highlight the usefulness of the Fibonacci sequence. Fibonacci even played a star role in Dan Brown's mega worldwide bestselling book, The Da Vinci Code, and later the film by the same name. There's no question that Fibonacci numbers are all around us. But, why should you care?<br /><br />New research by the award-winning Socionomics Institute suggests that Fibonacci might affect the way people think, the way individuals act in a crowd and even the way investors make financial decisions -- all are tied to the Fibonacci sequence. Several terms spawn from Fibonacci and what others call the Golden Ratio, including Spiral, Fractal, Herding, Golden Section, Golden Mean, Golden Number, Divine Ratio, Phi and more. However, there is only one one-stop-shop for everything Fibonacci, including the autonomous biography of the man that introduced Fibonacci to the Western world, Leonard of Pisa and the New Mathematics of the Middle Ages, otherwise known as Leonardo Fibonacci. This video is an excerpt from the Socionomic Institute's FREE online documentary History's Hidden Engine, which introduces the new science of Socionomics and the importance of Fibonacci in our everyday lives. If you'd like to watch the entire documentary or learn more about Fibonacci and the new science of Socionomics, check out additional resources at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.elliottwave.com/wave/FibonacciTube">http://www.elliottwave.com/wave/FibonacciTube</a> .{% endraw %}
