{% raw %}A vision-driven change agent with a career-long record of community outreach, leadership development, marketing, and communications success for leading organizations. Mr. Darryll Stinson seeks to use rejection as a powerful tool with which we can discover our true and complete identity based on a variety of healthy and holistic influences. Darryll’s theory is that by understanding who we are and what we are uniquely gifted and created to do, we can more healthily process the sting of rejection and turn the initial pain into strength to become a better version of ourselves.
