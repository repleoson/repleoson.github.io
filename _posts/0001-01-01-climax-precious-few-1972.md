{% raw %}Climax Precious and Few Lyrics:<br /><br /><br /><br />Precious and few are the moments we two can share. <br /><br />Quiet and blue, like the sky, I'm hung over you. <br /><br />And if I can't find my way back home (can't find my way), <br /><br />It just wouldn't be fair (be fair). <br /><br />Precious and few are the moments we two can share. <br /><br /><br /><br />Baby, it's you on my mind, your love is so rare. <br /><br />Being with you is a feeling I just can't compare. <br /><br />And if I can't hold you in my arms (can't hold you), <br /><br />It just wouldn't be fair (be fair). <br /><br />'Cause' precious and few are the moments we two can share. <br /><br /><br /><br />[Short instrumental break.] <br /><br /><br /><br />And if I can't find my way back home (can't find my way), <br /><br />Aww, it just wouldn't be fair (be fair). <br /><br />'Cause' precious and few are the moments we two can share. <br /><br />[ Find more Lyrics on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://mp3lyrics.org/q6UN">http://mp3lyrics.org/q6UN</a> ]<br /><br />(Precious and few are the moments we two can share.) <br /><br /><br /><br />Precious and few are the moments we two can share. <br /><br />Quiet and blue, like the sky, I'm hung over you. <br /><br />And if I can't find my way back home (can't find my way), <br /><br />Aww, it just wouldn't be fair (wouldn't be fair). <br /><br />'Cause' Precious and few are the moments we two can share. <br /><br />(Precious and few are the moments we two can share.) <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />[PRECIOUS &amp; FEW] <br /><br />[Written by: Walter Nims-1972 <br /><br />Performed by: Climax [1] -1972 (Marc Gordon-lead gutarist), Larry Cox-bass guitar, <br /><br />John Stevenson-keyboardist, Walter Nims-principal songwirter and guitarist, and <br /><br />Sonny Geraci-lead singer.) <br /><br />Appears on: Climax, Featuring Sonny Geraci-1972 [2] , After Dusk (Various Artists)-1986, <br /><br />Precious &amp; Few (CD)-1999, Wolfman Jack's Graffiti Gold: One-Hit Wonders (Various Artists)-2001, <br /><br />K-Tel's One-Hit Wonders (Various Artists)-2003, et al.] <br /><br /><br /><br />[1] Covered by: Ray Conniff-1972, Andy Williams-1972, Sonny Geraci-1998, et al.]{% endraw %}
