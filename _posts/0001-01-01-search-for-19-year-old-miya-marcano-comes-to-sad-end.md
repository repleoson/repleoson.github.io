{% raw %}Orange County Sheriff John Mina said, “Everyone wanted this outcome to be different,” but no one more than Miya Marcano’s family and friends. Florida authorities say they believe they have found the missing 19-year-old’s body. Miya Marcano had not been seen since Sept. 24 at the Central Florida apartment complex where she both lived and worked. She missed a flight to see her family, which prompted them to report her missing.{% endraw %}
