{% raw %}The goal of this talk is to begin the process of dismantling our implicit societal biases in order to move toward greater acceptance and celebration of our differences and work toward more cohesive, understanding communities.<br /><br />Denise Hernández graduated from Business Careers High School and<br /><br />attended Baylor University. Following encounters with explicit racism for the first time, she began to self-examine her place in society. She was selected as a<br /><br />“Rising Star in Their 20’s” by MySA.com in 2015 and is a co-founder of La Con Safos Beca, a scholarship for Chicano/Brown/undocumented students. She is<br /><br />the founder of Maestranza, which engages the community through education, outreach and activism. She is a Big Sister in the Big Brothers Big Sisters program, and an advocate against injustice, particularly related to police brutality, the school-to-prison pipeline, and education systems.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
