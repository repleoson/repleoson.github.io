{% raw %}Brimful Of Asha is from the classic When I Was Born For The 7th Time album.  It was John Peel's Festive 50 no.1 on BBC Radio 1 in 1997, and this version made it to no.1 in the UK charts.  Norman Cook liked the original so much he requested to mix it himself, and it resulted in one of the most well known tracks that the world has ever heard.{% endraw %}
