{% raw %}SATSANG OF THE WEEK<br />mooji.tv/satsang-of-the-week<br /><br />Moojibaba gives a potent and distilled guidance into the recognition of the pure sense ‘I Am.’ <br /><br />“Remain conscious just of the sense ‘I Am,’ without connecting to anything else. This itself will be a marvellous exercise for you. Then I would like to ask you after, ‘What did you find?’<br /><br />The more you are stabilising in this ‘I Am,’ you will see the wealth of this. You will feel the health of this. You will see the unending-ness of this. You will feel the joy and the love of this. You will feel the compassion and the wisdom of this. This you must find.”<br /><br />Excerpt from the Satsang, ’I Am' — Is It An Incomplete Statement or the Most Complete?<br />6 October 2019 | Morning Satsang<br />‘First’ Zmar Silent Retreat<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.tv/online-retreat/october2019/?olrv=35000#lr">https://mooji.tv/online-retreat/october2019/?olrv=35000#lr</a><br /><br />~<br /><br />This video is the ‘Satsang of the Week’ for 24 November 2019<br />To subscribe or watch this weekly service, please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.tv/satsang-of-the-week">https://mooji.tv/satsang-of-the-week</a><br /><br />#Mooji #satsang #spirituality #advaita #nonduality #awakening{% endraw %}
