The Discover It Secured Credit Card<br />This card has NO ANNUAL FEE. And you will get you 2% cash back on restaurants and gas stations up to the first $1000, AND you’ll get unlimited 1% cash back on everything else. They’re also running a promotion where they will MATCH your cash back in the first year. Not only that, but Discover also allows you to monitor your FICO score for free on their platform, so you can keep track of how your score is improving over time. <br /><br />2. The Petal 1 Visa Credit Card<br />They say that the Petal 1 looks beyond your credit score, by instead - looking at your banking history. Your Cash Score shows your creditworthiness and can help you qualify for more credit at better rates. With this, you can get a credit limit anywhere from $500 to $5000…and, BEST OF ALL, THERE’S NO ANNUAL FEE. They also offer anywhere from 2-10% back on select merchants, and their mobile interface helps you better understand how much you spend, what you’ll need to do to pay off your balance in full, and - will help you track your expenses over time. <br /><br />3. The Apple Credit Card<br />Like the others - NO ANNUAL FEE. They’ll also give you DAILY cash back…when you use the Apple Card with Apple Pay, you’ll get unlimited 2% cash back on everything. You’ll also get 3% cash back on Apple Products and select merchants. Their app is also fantastic for tracking expenses, and learning good financial habits to make sure you pay off your credit card as soon as possible to avoid paying interest. <br /><br />4. Bank of America Cash Rewards Card<br />I like this because they’ll give you a $200 cash bonus when you spend $1000 on the credit card within the first 90 days.Besides that, you’ll also get 3% cash back on the category of your choice, 2% cash back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs, and 1% cash back on everything else. You can also get a $200 Cash bonus when you spend $1000 in the first 90 days!<br /><br />5. Chase Freedom Flex Credit Card: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.referyourchasecard.com/18f/VQ8VGIJX6I">https://www.referyourchasecard.com/18f/VQ8VGIJX6I</a><br />First, they’ll be giving you a $200 bonus when you spend only $500 on purchases within the first 3 months…AND, you’ll earn 5% cash back on grocery store purchases on up to $12,000 spent in the first year!  They’ll also offer you 5% cash back on up to $1500 worth of bonus categories, 5% back on travel through the ultimate rewards portal, 3% back at restaurants and dining….3% on drugstores…and 1% back on everything else. All with no annual fee. <br /><br />Step By Step:<br /><br />First, sign up for the Discover It Secured Card with a $200 deposit. Once you get the card, all you need to do is put a few of your normal expenses on the card each month…and then pay it off in full. <br /><br />Second, if you want to expedite the credit building process just a little further…around the same time you apply for the Discover It card, also apply for the Petal 1 Visa Card. <br /><br />Third, after 6 months of doing this…you’ll want to apply for either the Apple Credit Card or Bank of America Card. These will be your first “unsecured credit cards.&quot;<br /><br />Fourth, from there…after 8-12 months from getting your first card…get the Chase freedom flex, and enjoy that free $200 cash back. <br /><br />Then, after 12 months…you should have built up enough of a credit foundation to have a score above 750, and then be able to take advantage of every amazing credit card offer out there to get thousands of dollars back in rewards, travel first class, and get free nights at the best hotels in the world! <br /><br />For business or one-on-one real estate investing/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com<br /><br />*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
