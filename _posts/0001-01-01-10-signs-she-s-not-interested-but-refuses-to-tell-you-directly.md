These are different though because these are the signs that she's not into you but she won't tell you verbally.<br /><br />You know those women that's not into you but doesn't tell you and yet let you pursue? This is how guys get dicked around.<br /><br />The first sign is liking your message on tinder and not responding. Guys, if you get that, just unmatch her.<br /><br />The second sign is trying to meet you halfway on a date.  <br /><br />The third sign is acting super unavailable. When a woman's super busy, just tell her to let you know when she's available and stop pursuing her.<br /><br />The fourth sign is taking a while to respond. This is obvious. It's a sign of passive interest so what you got to do is to take as long to respond to her as well.<br /><br />The fifth one is friendzoning you. Never expect a friendship, it never works out. <br /><br />The sixth sign is giving you maybe’s and could's.  If she says |maybe&quot; just respond with &quot;maybe?&quot; with a question mark and let her respond to that or you can be polite and ask her to let you know when she can be available. Just let her be and stop pursuing.<br /><br />The seventh sign is bringing a friend to a date. Usually, a woman will tell you that she's bringing a friend but just don't accept.<br /><br />The eight sign is inviting you to group dates. If she does this, just reschedule.<br /><br />The ninth sign is having things to do after the date. If she says she's going to do something after, just reschedule. If she has something else to do, don't even go.<br /><br />The tenth sign is cancelling last minute. This is the biggest sign of disinterest. The next time she wants to hang out, be difficult.<br /><br />These are subtle signs because women won't tell you that they don't like you. They will act that they like you though.<br /><br />Here's a link to the article version: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mindfulattraction.org/blog/2019/8/12/10-signs-shes-not-interested-but-refuses-to-tell-you-directly">https://mindfulattraction.org/blog/2019/8/12/10-signs-shes-not-interested-but-refuses-to-tell-you-directly</a><br /><br />Check out my course The Psychological Game of Attraction so you’ll learn all the techniques needed for you to attract a guy. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dalexis-school.thinkific.com/courses/the-dark-arts-of-attraction">https://dalexis-school.thinkific.com/courses/the-dark-arts-of-attraction</a>{% endraw %}
