{% raw %}YouTuber's Life 2 continues and we're forced to carry out some urgent upgrades to TeaBot because it turns out that although he can talk and fly and take videos and is aware of everything going on in the world around us, he's not waterproof... so that's a bit of a design flaw right there, and because of this we take him for an upgrade.<br /><br />It's Easter in NewTube City and although I do set out with the goal of just making lots of videos, we do get distracted a little by some exciting tagged photo opportunities and then we're distracted a lot by an Easter Egg hunt. But really.<br /><br />We do manage to record a few more videos to bump up our views and subscribers and things are most definitely going the right way but that ten thousand limit seems some way off.<br /><br />Also we buy some food for delivery, we find a dubious USB stick on the floor and we have a slight hardware issue with our PC...<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqCa31-K_PjmEty8WX3whyw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqCa31-K_PjmEty8WX3whyw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />YouTuber's Life 2 can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1493760/Youtubers_Life_2/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1493760/Youtubers_Life_2/</a><br /><br />----------------------------<br /><br />If youâ€™d like to connect with me, you can find me on...<br /><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/BccyEWv">https://discord.gg/BccyEWv</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheGeekCupboard">https://twitter.com/TheGeekCupboard</a><br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/thegeekcupboard">https://www.patreon.com/thegeekcupboard</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheGeekCupboard/">https://www.facebook.com/TheGeekCupboard/</a><br /><br />Reddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGeekCupboard/">https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGeekCupboard/</a><br /><br />Epic Games Creator Code: THEGEEKCUPBOARD<br /><br />----------------------------<br /><br />Create your own channel and decide which is the best content to cover: trending video games, improvised streamings, professional reviews...
