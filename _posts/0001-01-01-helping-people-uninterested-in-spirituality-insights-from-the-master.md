{% raw %}In this video, Paramahamsa Sri Swami Vishwananda talks about helping people who are uninterested in the spiritual path. Swamiji explains that if they truly are uninterested in what you have to say, then talking to them is of no use. Until they want to change and let go of expectations and want to know more, it is best to pray for them.<br /><br />In a time when millions of people are searching for answers to the never ending questions of life, the appeal of Paramahamsa Sri Swami Vishwananda is that he gives insights into life that go beyond religion, race, gender and social status. He stands out before us as the very embodiment of Love, ultimately inspiring us to live life with Love, faith, and trust in God.<br /><br />As it is said, ask and it shall be given, seek and you shall find, knock and the door will open. In the Insights from the Master series, the few who are searching for Love will receive Just Love from the Master.<br /><br />To learn more about Paramahamsa Vishwananda please visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.paramahamsavishwananda.com">http://www.paramahamsavishwananda.com</a>{% endraw %}
