{% raw %}No Time To Die is out! So here's Spectre! James Bond 24. It's the other one that most people seem to not like. Is it long? I guess so, slow? I don't really think so. Contrived? No way! Nothing is ever contrived in a James Bond movie! So are they wrong? Iunno. Here's everything right with Spectre!
