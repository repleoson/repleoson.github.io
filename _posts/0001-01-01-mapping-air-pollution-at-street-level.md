{% raw %}EDF, Google, Aclima, and the University of Texas at Austin measured and mapped air pollution using Googleâ€™s Street View Cars in Oakland. The results have validated much of what local air quality advocates West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project have known for years. We hope this new data can help residents and community groups alike advocate for cleaner air.
