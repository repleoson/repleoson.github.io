{% raw %}The improper integral of sin^2(x)/x^2 from -inf to inf. We actually just need integration by parts (DI method) and the fact that the integral of sin(x)/x from neg inf to inf is pi ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/s1zhYD4x6mY.">https://youtu.be/s1zhYD4x6mY.</a> <br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------<br />If you find my channel helpful and would like to support, then you can <br />subscribe by clicking ðŸ‘‰  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/just_calc">https://bit.ly/just_calc</a><br />support me Patreon: ðŸ‘‰  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/blackpenredpen">https://www.patreon.com/blackpenredpen</a><br />buy a math shirt or a hoodie: ðŸ‘‰  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/bprp_merch">https://bit.ly/bprp_merch</a><br /><br />&quot;Just Calculus&quot; is dedicated to helping students who are taking precalculus, AP calculus, GCSE, A-Level, year 12 maths, college calculus, or high school calculus.
