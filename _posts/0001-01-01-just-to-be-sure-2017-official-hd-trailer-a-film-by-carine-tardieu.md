Thanks to a local private detective he soon locates the mischievous, 70-something Joseph (Le Havre’s Andre Wilms), whom it seems his mother may have known briefly. Erwan soon falls not only for his charm, but that of the impetuous Anna (a radiant Cécile de France), who has ties to them both. But the conflicting loyalties become compounded by the pregnancy of his own daughter, who defiantly refuses to name the father… very soon Erwan’s families begin to collide, to unexpected, hilarious and moving effect.<br /><br />Offering a terrific showcase for her brilliant cast, director Carine Tardieu skillfully weaves a wholly-entertaining exploration of human relationships, co-incidence and love. Few films manage to pluck both the heartstrings and the funny bone as well as JUST TO BE SURE. It’s a delight.{% endraw %}
