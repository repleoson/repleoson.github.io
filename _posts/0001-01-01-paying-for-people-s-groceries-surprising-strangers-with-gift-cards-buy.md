{% raw %}It's become an annual tradition we look forward to every year. This is our third year in a row paying for people's groceries and surprising strangers with shopping gifts cards during the holidays. This time of year everyone could use a little pick me up, and I think especially this year more than ever. The emotional reactions of people receiving shopping gift cards and having their groceries paid for shows their immense gratitude.<br /><br />Being able to pay it forward by paying for people's groceries is something that would not be possible without all of you! In fact, we ourselves have been the recipients of strangers' service leaving groceries on our doorstep or dropping off Christmas presents when we couldn't afford them on our own. We've always been grateful for the kindness and generosity of others throughout our lives. And now, thanks to all of you, we are able to pay it forward and give back and give thanks by helping others. <br /><br />We can never thank you enough for the life you have given us but we can do our part to inspire others to do the same. We hope this video will inspire you to give back, to give thanks, to pay it forward any way you can. You'd be surprised how the littlest things can make the biggest difference in the lives of others. <br /><br />#ThisIsHowWeBingham #TIHWB<br /><br />FIRST YEAR PAYING FOR PEOPLE'S GROCERIES: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/W0yVgnsxORE">https://youtu.be/W0yVgnsxORE</a><br /><br />SECOND YEAR PAYING FOR PEOPLE'S GROCERIES: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/kiWKNOHW7M8">https://youtu.be/kiWKNOHW7M8</a><br /><br />OUR ORIGINAL INSPIRATION: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/XHcvMbYoAv4">https://youtu.be/XHcvMbYoAv4</a><br /><br />Yesterday's VLOG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/oyQkYNhiuBY">https://youtu.be/oyQkYNhiuBY</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE and tell your friends ;)<br /><br />LET'S BE FAMILY EVERYWHERE!<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/ThisIsHowWeBingham">http://facebook.com/ThisIsHowWeBingham</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/ThisIsHowWeBingham">http://instagram.com/ThisIsHowWeBingham</a><br />@ThisIsHowWeBingham<br /><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tihwb">https://www.tiktok.com/@tihwb</a><br />@TIHWB<br /><br />TWITCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/thisishowwebingham">https://www.twitch.tv/thisishowwebingham</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/HowWeBingham">http://twitter.com/HowWeBingham</a><br />@HowWeBingham<br /><br />Snapchat: @HowWeBingham<br /><br />Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thisishowwebingham.com">http://thisishowwebingham.com</a><br /><br />Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thisishowwebingham.com/shop">http://thisishowwebingham.com/shop</a><br /><br />BEST OF BINGHAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/N4ufP8vPXCI">https://youtu.be/N4ufP8vPXCI</a><br /><br />Mailing Address:<br />P.O.
