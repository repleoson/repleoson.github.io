You can use the prayer to get money from husband or someone else.<br /><br />The Gospels document two versions of this prayer: a longer version in Matthew's Sermon on the Mount, and a shorter version in Luke's Gospel, when ‚Äúone of his disciples said to him, 'Lord, teach us to pray, as John said to his disciples' ¬ª. (NRSV) Luke 11: 1. The Mathean version, delivered by Jesus early in his ministry in Galilee, and the Lucan version, delivered a year later, &quot;quite possibly in Judea,&quot; according to the Lutheran theologian Harold Buls. 1.<br /><br />The first three of Matthew's seven requests address God, while the remaining four address human needs and concerns. The requests &quot;Thy will be done&quot; and &quot;Rescue us from evil&quot; (or &quot;Deliver us from evil&quot;) appear only in Matthew's account. The adjective epiousios appears in both original Greek texts; Although it is debatable, &quot;regular&quot; has become the most popular translation of this phrase in Spanish. Protestants often end the sentence with a doxology, which is a later addition found in some manuscripts of Matthew.{% endraw %}
