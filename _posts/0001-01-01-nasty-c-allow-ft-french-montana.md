{% raw %}Nsikayesizwe David Ngcobo, better known by his stage name Nasty C, originates from Durban in the KwaZulu-Natal Province. He started rapping at the age of nine, having been influenced by his older brother who was a producer at the time.<br /><br />Between 2013 and 2015 Nasty C dropped three mixtapes, <br />One Kid A Thousand Coffins, C L.A.M.E. and Price City. But it was the one-off single, “Juice Back,” and the ensuing remix (featuring Davido and Cassper Nyovest), that propelled him into the spotlight. In 2016 Nasty C delivered his inaugural album, Bad Hair, and gave it away for free. The critically acclaimed award winning commercial re-release, Bad Hair Extensions, featured four new tracks, including a collaboration with US rap artist, French Montana.<br /><br />Get his brand new album ‘Strings And Bling’ here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nastyc.lnk.to/StringsAndBling">https://nastyc.lnk.to/StringsAndBling</a>{% endraw %}
