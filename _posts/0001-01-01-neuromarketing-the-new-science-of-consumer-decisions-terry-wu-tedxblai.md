{% raw %}Dr. Wu received his Master's degree in Neuroscience from Duke University and earned his Ph.D. in Neuroscience at Vanderbilt University, focusing on research into learning and memory. He then began a 20-year career in Neuroscience at the University of Minnesota. He built one of the first two local marketing firms that specialize in Search Engine Optimization, science-based website design and conversion optimization. Over the last 20 years, growing research from Neuroscience, Social Psychology and Behavioral Economics has been providing new insights on how the brain makes buying decisions. That gave birth to a new field, Neuromarketing. With his extensive knowledge and experience in both Neuroscience and marketing, Dr. Wu helps businesses grow revenues rapidly by guiding their customers to make informed decisions. Today, his company, Neuromarketing Services, based in the Twin Cities, is the only Neuromarketing firm in the Midwest.
