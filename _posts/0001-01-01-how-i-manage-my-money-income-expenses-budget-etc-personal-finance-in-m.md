{% raw %}Thank you to Nordgreen for sponsoring this video! If you're interested in getting your own watch, here's the link:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2MzfvRj">https://bit.ly/2MzfvRj</a> and you can use my discount code LINALE for 15% off. <br /><br />In this video, I show you guys how I keep track of my finances in my 20s , so everything from my income , expenses , budget , net income , and some of the information that I need to do my taxes with when that time comes around ( business expenses , business income ). Honestly, when I was first learning about how to track my money ... I found it to be a little bit overwhelming even though it felt like it should have been really easy . Turns out, once you've set up your system , it can be super straight forward and then it's just a matter of including this into your end of month routine . I kind of wish they taught us a bit more about how to manage finances in school, but hey I guess the internet is a good place to learn. I'm by no means an expert, and this is just what I do , but thought it would still be helpful to some of you or at least give you ideas on how to manage your money! I used microsoft excel for my spreadsheets ... but you can totally use something like Google sheets as well :)<br /><br />‚ú© Timestamps ‚ú©<br />0:00  - Intro <br />0:40  - What do I use? + important info about my file<br />1:49 - Personal Finances Sheet : Income<br />2:20 - Nordgreen <br />5:40 - Personal Finances Sheet: Income <br />6:25 - Personal Finances Sheet: Expenses <br />9:26 - Personal Finances Sheet: Budget <br />10:05 - Personal Finances Sheet: Net Income <br />10:39 - Personal Finances Sheet: Bank Accounts <br />11:27 - Personal Finances Sheet: Credit Cards <br />11:58 - Business Finances Sheet: Business Income<br />14:00 - Business Finances Sheet: Business Expenses <br />15:25 - Outro<br /><br />‚ú© GOOGLE SHEETS / EXCEL TEMPLATE ‚ú©<br /><br />Update (August 2021): Since some of you requested it, here's a google sheets template that you can use for your own finances: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jk2zghNC1A3OSbXkqwKu4DKZx0MAY1BHf99O3j5dHSQ/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jk2zghNC1A3OSbXkqwKu4DKZx0MAY1BHf99O3j5dHSQ/edit?usp=sharing</a> <br />All you have to do is hit &quot;File -- Make a Copy&quot; and you'll have your own copy to edit. I left it the same as it is in the video, so obviously rename things according to your own financial needs (change streams of income, some expenses might not apply to you, different bank accounts, etc.). <br />If you want it as an Excel File on your computer instead of Google Sheets, just hit &quot;File - Download - Microsoft Excel&quot;. I hope that's somewhat helpful to those of you requesting it - might help speed things up! I do recommend you still follow along with the video to understand some of it :)<br /><br />‚ú© EXPENSES CATEGORIES LIST SHOWN IN VIDEO ‚ú©<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mint.intuit.com/mint-categories/">https://mint.intuit.com/mint-categories/</a> - pick and choose what works for you! you can also google other ones. <br /><br />‚ú© Social Media ‚ú©<br />Instagram and TikTok - @lina.lecompte<br />Twitter and Pinterest- @linalecompte<br /><br />‚ú© Cameras ‚ú©<br />Canon 80D w/18-55mm lens<br />Canon G7X Mark II <br /><br />‚ú© Editing Software ‚ú©<br />Adobe Premiere Pro<br /><br />‚ú© Music ‚ú©<br />Epidemic Sound<br />Use my referral link for a free month: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/qvu92n/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/qvu92n/</a><br /><br />‚ú© Social Media Bars ‚ú©<br />Brogan Algar - her channel: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_O39qqVJt4FT2NcCD2qVvw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_O39qqVJt4FT2NcCD2qVvw</a><br /><br />Keywords: how to track money , how to manage your money , how to keep track of your money , how to track your expenses , how to track your income , how to track your money in excel  , personal finance for beginners , personal finance 101 , personal finance for students , personal finances in your 20s , budget with me , money tips  , tracking your money , managing your money , money management{% endraw %}
