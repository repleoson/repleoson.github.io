{% raw %}Good Morning E.T Fam?! I hope Friday is treating everyone well. I have some thoughts to share with you all. As the market continues to cool down, I hope you all are paying attention to the projects that are holding their value. I’ll spell it out for everyone…G-A-M-I-N-G. That’s right. The sector that ol Ellio has been ringing the alarm about is proving itself. <br /><br />Fam, there’s a reason that I’ve chosen to dedicate all of my time, effort, and resources to crypto gaming. It truly is the best catalyst that will bring crypto to the masses. It is also the sector that has the best chance of surviving the bull market without any fumbles. This is because gaming has never gone out of style. Whether there’s a bull or bear market, people will always engage in gaming. <br /><br />Plus, the gaming community is the most dedicated community within any industry. This means that choosing the right projects can literally make your portfolio that much more bear-proof. If we look at the epic move that Axie made during the summer, we can see that we’ve only touched the tip of the iceberg. We’ve also seen other big performers like Gala Games kill it. Now, anything can happen, and I’m not saying that the crypto gaming sector will never experience a cool off period. <br /><br />However, what I am saying is that a dip is unlikely to be as severe as we’ve seen in other sectors. I’m laser beamed focused, and I hope you all are as well. Talk to you all soon!<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />01:14 - Crash resistant<br />02:10 - The Axie Infinity case<br />04:01 - The hottest trend right now<br />05:41 - UFO : The next Axie Infinity?<br />06:21 - Look for this category of projects <br />06:55 - Star Atlas : A study case<br />09:08 - Project #1<br />09:45 - Project #2<br />10:25 - Outro<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This is not financial advice!
