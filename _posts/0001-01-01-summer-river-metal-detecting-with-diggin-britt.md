{% raw %}My first ever filmed metal detecting video!!  I had a really fun time on this little metal detecting adventure!  We find all sorts of interesting old metal relics and rusty cool things..as well as some old pottery shards!  It was super crazy hot on this summer day (over 103 degrees!), so it was nice to be so close to the cool water in the river.  Those of you that know me already, know that I LOVE animals and at the end of this video I see some stranded little fish with their habitat drying out, so of course I have to save them! ❤️ <br />I hope y'all enjoy, and please subscribe for more metal detecting and relic hunting adventures!  Thanks for watchin' and GL and HH y'all!<br />Love,<br />Diggin Britt xo<br /><br />Subscribe to my YouTube channel! goo.gl/608R0m<br /><br />Find me on instagram @DigginBritt<br /><br />Filmed In the United States of America<br /><br />© 2016 Diggin Britt ALL RIGHTS RESERVED<br />This video may not be copied or re-posted without my express written consent.{% endraw %}
