{% raw %}WHO AM I:<br />I'm Ken, retired at 38. From employee to running few companies, I tried it all. Investing in Stocks and buying the right stocks brought me to retirement. My goal my love my passion is to inspire and help others achieve financial independence. I break down complicated numbers, simplify it. I do this for free, no paywall, 100% transparency, no sponsors. <br /><br />I talk about stocks to buy / disruptive stocks / multi-baggers or generally anything to do with money.{% endraw %}
