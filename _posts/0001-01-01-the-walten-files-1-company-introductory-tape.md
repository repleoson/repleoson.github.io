{% raw %}&quot;Tape 1:<br /><br />This is a compilation of Tapes created by the already extinct Bunny Smiles Company<br />I tried to get as much info as I could about what these tapes are, all I could find was that these tapes were handed to new employees back in 1974-1979 the rest of the tapes seem to be recorded by a new &quot;Facility Caretaker&quot; in the year 1982, Hopefully, I can find more tapes soon.<br /><br />-Anthony&quot;<br /><br />Soundtrack: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Sh_75_X9IWaPSNGPFCMgg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Sh_75_X9IWaPSNGPFCMgg</a><br />Voice of Brian Stells:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmHUU4CLhbgm1BKzGm8FTgA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmHUU4CLhbgm1BKzGm8FTgA</a><br />Car footage belongs to zepter00: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/user/zepter00">https://youtube.com/user/zepter00</a>{% endraw %}
