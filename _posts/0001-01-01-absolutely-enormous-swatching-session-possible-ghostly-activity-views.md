{% raw %}Yes folks, it's a long one! Nearly an hour and a half of calm swatching over the course of two autumnal days at the end of October. I've decided to do something different in this one and I've broken up the swatching with views of our garden, and later on, you can see the house and garden at dusk as I head out for a walk before it gets dark. This video is perfect to put on in the background while you work. Make yourself a hot drink (Green &amp; Black's Hot Chocolate or Clipper Organic Tea with milk and one sugar for me!) and sit back, relax, and enjoy these beautiful colours. I'm swatching several different mediums from the October Art Haul including coloured pencils, watercolour pencils, Neocolor 1 &amp; 2 wax pastels, gouache, acrylic gouache, paint markers, watercolour pens, graphite matt pencils, acrylic paint and acrylic ink.<br /><br />‚ú∑‚ú∑‚ú∑<br /><br />ART SUPPLIES<br /><br />I buy most of my materials from Jackson‚Äôs Art Supplies.
