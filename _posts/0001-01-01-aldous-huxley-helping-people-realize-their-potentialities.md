Early in his career Huxley edited the magazine Oxford Poetry, and published short stories and poetry. Mid career and later, he published travel writing, film stories and scripts. He spent the later part of his life in the US, living in Los Angeles from 1937 until his death. In 1962, a year before his death, he was elected Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature.[1]<br /><br />Huxley was a humanist, pacifist, and satirist. He later became interested in spiritual subjects such as parapsychology and philosophical mysticism,[2][3] in particular, Universalism.[4] By the end of his life, Huxley was widely acknowledged as one of the pre-eminent intellectuals of his time.[5] He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in seven different years.{% endraw %}
