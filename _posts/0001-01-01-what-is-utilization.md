{% raw %}What is utilization and why does it matter so much. The big four accounting firms generate revenue by having many CPAs charge their time to client codes.<br /><br />The amount of hours multiplied by the person's billable rate gives the amount billed to the client. How much the big 4 audit firms bill their clients is their revenue. <br /><br />The metric that the big 4 use to measure their staff people is utilization. Utilization is the number of billable hours that a person works divided by the total number of hours that person worked for the year.<br /><br />A person's utilization affects many thing in the big four careers including their performance appraisal.<br /><br />Visit www.thebig4accountingfirms.com for more details.{% endraw %}
