You are proud of me, I know. But I also know you are disappointed. Disappointed maybe in the fact that I am dating a woman. We don't talk about it and I cant find any words to start a conversation about it. A conversation to tell you how happy I am and how much this person cares about me. I’m in a relationship, and I don't think you could ever see that. It hurts because as I’m writing this I feel so much pain in the happiness that I have found. It’s nice when we do visit you that you are able to have a conversation with her but I know it hurts you to see me in this light. But it’s okay, I have to remind myself that it’s okay to be who I am. I love you and I know you will always love me. I just want you to be proud of me. Look at all that I’ve accomplished especially when it comes to my heart.<br />It really hurt me when you didn't come to the screening of this video, but I understand why. I wish it weren't this way. I hope you forgive me for sharing this open letter but I think by sharing part of my story it might help others that are in similar situations, gay or straight. <br />I hope one day you can ‪#‎hearmylove‬.<br /><br />LOVE. ACCEPTANCE. PRIDE. EQUALITY.<br /><br /><br />Video Credits<br />Story by: Carolyn Cardoza, Irene Diaz, Michael Beserra, Jessica Ramirez<br />Editor, Director: Michael Beserra (Elefante Collective)<br />Assistant Director: Carolyn Cardoza<br />Producer: Carolyn Cardoza, Michael Beserra, Irene Diaz<br /><br />Cast<br />Stephane: Melissa Carmona <br />Jessica: Candace Dovie<br />Father: Michael A.
