{% raw %}If you have ants in your pants, that normally means you can’t sit still and have too much energy. Or it might mean you actually do have ants in your pants, and that’s highly creepy. When ants start an invasion of your home and yard, you gotta be prepared to fight them off. If you aren’t a huge fan of chemical pesticides (they can be harmful to humans) – there are natural ways to get rid of those annoying insects and keep them out for good. <br /><br />Some pest repellents that you can find right in your kitchen cabinet or garden! Did you know, for example, that сinnamon can work as a double agent here? It makes your house smell like a dream and helps you defer ants at the same time. Another affordable thing ants totally hate is vinegar. You can spray it onto the ants, around the windowsills, doorways, and places that ants love. And, there’ll be no scent left behind after it dries! <br /><br />Other videos you might like:<br />If You Get This Plant at Home, You’ll Never See Mice, Spiders, or Ants Again <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdJnRxYjOmI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdJnRxYjOmI</a><br />10 Natural Ways to Get Rid of Ants And Bugs In Your House <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naRwoyeZ3KA&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naRwoyeZ3KA&amp;</a><br />10 Bug Bites You Should Be Able to Identify <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN_uzGCaR0U&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN_uzGCaR0U&amp;</a><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />Citrus fruits 0:33<br />Cucumber slices 1:09<br />Peppermint 1:48<br />Cinnamon 2:12<br />Coffee grounds 2:51<br />Tansy 3:23<br />Diatomaceous earth 3:45<br />Chalk 4:19<br />Baking soda and powdered sugar 4:37<br />Cornmeal 5:12<br />Vinegar 5:34<br />Borax, water and sugar 6:01<br />Boiling water and dish soap 6:48<br />Mini moat 7:10<br /><br />#ants #cleanhome #brightside<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />- You might love the smell of oranges, lemons, and grapefruit, but ants just can’t stand it! Use this knowledge to your advantage.<br />- Similar to citrus fruits, cucumbers smell like trouble to ants. Apparently, there’s something in their chemical composition that eliminates the fungi that ants love a lot.<br />- If you have ants in your kitchen and bathroom, you can repel them using peppermint essential oil. Sprinkle cotton balls with a few drops and leave them in areas where the ants hang out.<br />- If you mix cinnamon oil with water in a spray bottle and sprinkle it on ant trails, windows, doors and cracks, it’ll have an even stronger effect. <br />- Before you throw away used coffee grounds after you enjoy a hot cup, remember they can, in fact, be of good use to you. Put them right in the cracks, sprinkle them around the flower bed, or even the entire base of your house.<br />- Tansy flowers might look cute to you but not to the ants! Plant it near your front door, under full or indirect sun and in pretty dry soil, or among other plants you want to protect from ants. <br />- Food grade diatomaceous earth is a fine silica powder of fossilized algae. It’s perfectly safe for humans, but dangerous for insects. <br />- No ant shall pass a border made of chalk, since they can’t walk across powdery materials.<br />- Ants love sugar but can’t stand baking soda. The smell of sugar will attract them, and baking soda will say “hi” to their digestive system, and the results are pretty dramatic for them. <br />- Cornmeal isn’t the quickest way to ruin an ant colony, but it’s completely harmless to humans and super cheap, so you might want to give it a go. <br />- Make a thin paste of powdered Borax laundry booster, sugar and water in equal parts. Put a few tablespoons of it on a jar lid and set the bait. This solution attracts all possible kinds of ants with its sugary smell. <br />- Another ant secret they don’t want you to know is that they just hate hot water. Yes, something as simple as that makes them tremble with fear.<br />- Most ants just go for the food, but some love plants, both potted and planted ones. To prevent them from building a home in what’s adding aesthetics to your own home, try setting up a moat filled with water, much like people did in ancient times building fortresses. <br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Stock materials (photos, footages and other):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com">https://www.shutterstock.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eastnews.ru">https://www.eastnews.ru</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
