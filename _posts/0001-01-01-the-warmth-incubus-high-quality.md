{% raw %}High Quality(320kbps) audio of The Warmth by Incubus. (Watch in 720p for best quality)<br /><br />I'd like to close my eyes, go numb <br />But there's a cold wind coming from <br />The top of the highest high rise today<br />It's not a breeze 'cuz it blows hard <br />Yes and it wants me to discard <br />The humanity I know, watched the warmth blow away<br /><br />So don't let the world bring you down <br />Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold <br />Remember why you came and while you're alive <br />Experience the warmth before you grow old<br /><br />So do you think I should adhere <br />To that pressing new frontier <br />And leave in my wake, a trail of fear<br />Should I hold my head up high? <br />And throw a wrench and spokes by <br />I'm leaving the air behind me clear<br /><br />So don't let the world bring you down <br />Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold <br />Remember why you came and while you're alive <br />Experience the warmth before you grow, before you grow old<br /><br />So don't let the world bring you down <br />Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold <br />Remember why you came and while you're alive <br />Experience the warmth before you grow old, before you grow old<br /><br />Where did it go?{% endraw %}
