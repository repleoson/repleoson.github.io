{% raw %}‘USING’ With Emily Warren Available Now : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://RITUAL.lnk.to/UsingID">https://RITUAL.lnk.to/UsingID</a> <br /><br />Watch The Official Behind The Scenes : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://RITUAL.lnk.to/UsingBTSID">https://RITUAL.lnk.to/UsingBTSID</a><br /><br />Check out the Behind The Scenes of the Using video.. this song is about being ‘used’ by someone, how that can feel and how it feels to realise that it’s happened to you.. with the video we wanted to explore themes of ‘users’ in the social media world - how dangerous it can be when ‘users’ of social media spend more time worrying about what people think in a digital ‘reality’ and forgetting what really matters ‘IRL’...  I know most of us can relate to what can be serious mental health challenges that these platforms present... our message is to not get lost trying to be something you are not, enjoy communicating with like minded people however you do but  stay present and loyal to the people who love and support you for who you really are ... we appreciate everyone sharing this song and this message.
