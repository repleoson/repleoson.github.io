{% raw %}We have one important thing to say - F.U.! Sounds nasty, right? But it’s the most pure thing on our planet: The Family Unit. After raising four children in our own Brady Bunch household and witnessing thousands of other parental situations succeed and fail, we learned one single important fact - families who played together, stayed together. Children and adults who feel loved tend to be more fulfilled, less depressed, and more successful in all aspects of their lives. We realized happiness hinges upon the FU - the Family Unit. <br /><br />Sometime in the 1940s or 1950s, a soon to be wealthy genius decided rather than having several generations cohabitate in the same shared home, they could sell twice as many refrigerators, ovens, sofas, radios, televisions, and mortgages if they could convince upcoming generations they weren’t supposed to live with their parents. This had profound effects on children from the Boomers forward that can be felt in today’s society. Businesses and marketers successfully destabilized the traditional multilayered family support system in exchange for unprecedented economic growth. We built a house of cards, and it’s finally collapsing upon itself. <br /><br />The good news is we’re seeing a slight reversal of this trend, albeit non-voluntarily, as a result of shifting economic policies and a constricting job market resulting from digital transformations, automation, outsourcing, and artificial intelligence. Families are beginning to recombine. We think this is great news.<br /><br />You can support this movement! The Family Unit brand donates part of its proceeds to the Indie Originals non-profit organization that supports homeless children and helps independent and underprivileged children and adults create music, movies, books, and other forms of creative arts.  <br />Plus, you’ve got to admit, our social statement is a catchy little phrase and logo too. Show your F.U. and support the resurgence of the Family Unit!<br />Thank you. <br /><br />#family #activities #parenting{% endraw %}
