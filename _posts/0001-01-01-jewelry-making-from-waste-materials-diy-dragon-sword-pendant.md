{% raw %}jewelry making from waste materials - DIY sword dragon pendant<br /><br />in this video i will show you how to make jewelry making from waste materials, i just got the idea after visiting a metalsmith workshop that produces copper crafts, of course there i saw a lot of unused copper pieces, at that moment i thought to make jewelry using the waste, and i decided to make a dragon sword pendant. i use copper to make dragon then for my sword i use rusty nails that i found in my own warehouse, as usual i only use the simple basic tools i have to make the work, so you can easily try this at home and start your jewelry bussines,<br /><br />#dragonswordpendant<br />#turnmetalwasteintojewelry<br />#handmadejewelry<br />#jewelrytomakeathome{% endraw %}
