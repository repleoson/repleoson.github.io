Every time you wanted to do something, your mom and dad rightly said, &quot;We pay the rent here. You do what we tell you.&quot; When you turned 18 you got your own apartment. You had privacy and freedom, it felt good. The same goes for you as an entrepreneur. When you finally go and sign your own office lease, you feel free.
