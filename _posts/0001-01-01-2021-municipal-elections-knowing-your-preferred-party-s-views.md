{% raw %}The SA Voters Guide has done a survey on the elections, the various political parties, as well as the issues they faced during campaigning. The survey which has been done for the past 30 years, gives voters the opportunity to know where their preferred parties stand in terms of various social issues. For more, eNCA speaks to Bongani Luthuli from the SA Voters Guide. Courtesy #DStv403{% endraw %}
