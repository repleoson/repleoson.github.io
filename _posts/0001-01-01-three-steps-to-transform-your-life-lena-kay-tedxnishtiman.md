{% raw %}Lena Kay shares the 3 steps on how she went from being in a homeless shelter with a brain tumour to living the life of her dreams and how you can transform your life using the same process.<br /><br />Lena Kay is a Transformation coach who was born in North Iraq and raised in London.  A university dropout she managed a chain of 10 gambling establishments before moving onto RBS business banking where she arose as a team leader. <br /><br />By her mid 20’s she found herself homeless, depressed, overweight with a brain tumour and living on benefits. She discovered neuroscience and quantum physics, used the knowledge to transform her life and helped many people on her journey as she organically fell into coaching. <br /><br />Lena now empowers individuals, entrepreneurs and groups to transform and become who they need to be, to maximise their potential and live life on their own terms.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
