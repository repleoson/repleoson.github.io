{% raw %}When you feel like you're ready to submit your work to an illustration agency, you want to make sure you are doing everything right. If you submit your portfolio the right way, you can be pretty sure it will be looked at by the right people. <br />Illustration agency submission guidelines vary, and what works for one agency, won't work for all of them. <br /><br />My guide to illustration agency submissions:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://theillustratorsguide.com/illustration-agency-submissions/">https://theillustratorsguide.com/illustration-agency-submissions/</a><br /><br />#illustrationAgency #illustration<br /><br />My name is James and I'm an illustration agent. I like to make myself useful and Iâ€™m always interested to hear what questions, or problems aspiring illustrators have. Maybe I can help, or maybe I know someone who can.{% endraw %}
