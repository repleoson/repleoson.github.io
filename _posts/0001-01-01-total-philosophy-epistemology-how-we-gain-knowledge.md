{% raw %}In this video we look at different philosopher's theories on how we obtain knowledge. We will discuss the philosophies of the philosophers: John Locke, David Hume, René Descartes and Immanuel Kant.  <br /><br />Feedback is much appreciated. We are always looking for ways to improve the quality of our videos, so if you have any suggestions please do not hesitate to tell us!<br /><br />You can follow us on our Twitter and Facebook feeds here:<br /><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TotalPhilosophy">https://twitter.com/TotalPhilosophy</a><br /><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TotalPhilosophy">https://www.facebook.com/TotalPhilosophy</a><br /><br />Footnotes: These are things that I had to omit from the video due to them making the video too long, but are too short to make their own full length videos. I have therefore added them as footnotes, which will soon become short 20 sec videos. <br /><br />* <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5_iUWIC2Kc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5_iUWIC2Kc</a><br /><br />† - You may have noticed earlier that I said that Kant was neither an empiricist nor a rationalist. The reason why Kant is not an empiricist is because he argues that we can never have true experience of the world, since we have to experience everything through the lens of our predetermined conceptual schemes. Kant called this world we experience the Phenomenal world. Therefore we are not empiricists since pure sense experience alone would allow us to gain knowledge of the Noumenal world, how the world really is.<br /><br />The reason why he is not a rationalist is because Kant argued that no knowledge can be gained by reason alone, we still need to have experienced things in order to gain knowledge.<br /><br />Speaking of things we can have no knowledge of<br />-Evil Demon removed{% endraw %}
