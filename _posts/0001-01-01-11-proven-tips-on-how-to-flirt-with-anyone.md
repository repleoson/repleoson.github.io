{% raw %}How to Flirt. Flirting might seem like something overwhelming or awkward, but in fact the more you learn about it and the more you practice it, the better you’ll get at it. It’s normal to be a little nervous around someone you like, but these simple tips can help set you at ease so that you’ll be confident and comfortable and make your crush like you. <br />The key to flirting is balance. Reveal your feelings, but keep the person intrigued and wanting to know more as well. You want them to think about you the way you think about them. You want them to feel special and flattered and comfortable with you.<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS<br />Watch for warning signs. 1:12<br />Make eye contact. 2:12<br />Smile 3:13<br />Start simply. 4:05<br />Be a conversationalist. 4:49<br />Keep it light. 5:52<br />Listen to your body language. 7:18<br />Break the touch barrier. 8:19<br />Compliment early, and compliment often. 9:39<br />Keep it short and sweet. 11:11<br />Be honest. 11:52<br /><br />Music: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music">https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music</a><br /><br />SUMMARY<br />-Do not approach someone who doesn’t want to be approached. Do not try to force someone to talk to you. Respect their space and boundaries. <br />-A shared glance is one of the most intimate things we can do without touching each other. You’ll learn a lot about a person by meeting their eyes and watching their expression.<br />-Show your crush you like them with a real, genuine smile. Smile when you make eye contact. This adds extra weight to the intimacy of locking eyes.<br />-Start with a comfortable, easy line of dialogue. Say hello and introduce yourself, especially if you don’t know each other well or at all.<br />-Strike up a conversation about something easily observed, like the weather or if there are a lot of people gathered around you. Find common ground with the person.<br />-Don’t bring up anything too personal or controversial. Avoid topics like religion, money, and politics. Don’t talk about your ex or say that you’re looking for a relationship — that starts to sound pushy.<br />-You’re communicating with your body, and so is your crush. If they’re closed off, you might want to stop trying to flirt.<br />-If you think your crush wants to be touched but hasn’t said anything, casually touch them on the forearm as you talk, or brush against them if you’re sitting next to each other.<br />-Be very careful about complimenting their looks, even if that’s what originally drew you to them. Try to look deeper, and mix in compliments about nonphysical features.<br />-Once you’ve sparked an interest, too much attention will smother it, and you’ll come off as too intense. See if they approach you, rather than the other way around.<br />-If your crush ever asks you what you’re looking for, just be honest. And that means being honest with yourself as well as with your crush.<br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br /><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
