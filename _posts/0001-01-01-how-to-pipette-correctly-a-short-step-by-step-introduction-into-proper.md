Your assays will be more reproducible and reliable without depending on one person doing the experiment. We will show each important step in pipetting from the operation of the buttons to dispensing of the liquid. We give valuable information on each handling move and explain in detail all critical points during pipetting. You will learn about the correct aspiration angle and immersion depth and receive reasons why these considerations are of great importance. We clarify the term and practice of pre-wetting by showing how to do it. In the last step of pipetting you will learn about the appropriate dispensing angle and performance of blow-out to achieve most reliable and reproducible results.{% endraw %}
