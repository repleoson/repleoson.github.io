{% raw %}Aminé - Charmander - Live Session | Vevo Ctrl<br /><br />In the summer of ’16 we invited Aminé into our DSCVR program off the heat of his breakout hit “Caroline.” The next year, we bumped up the affable Portland rhymer to LIFT status, believing he’d carved a place on the scene for years to come. Considering the range of flows, feels, and vision the rapper displayed on last year’s ‘Limbo,’ that bet has paid off. “Charmander” is from Aminé’s new ‘TwoPointFive’ project, a nominal sequel to a 2018 mixtape. Experimenting in loopy, ethereal arpeggios, it’s chill on the surface, but actually reveals an Aminé contending with, and ultimately being contented by, loneliness. Why the track is named after the adorable fire Pokémon has been left up to keen fans of both the anime and rapper to figure out. “I’ve been taking care of me,” raps Aminé again and again. That’s a mantra we could all do well to repeat to ourselves these days.<br /><br />Aminé<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/amine/">https://www.instagram.com/amine/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/heyamine">https://twitter.com/heyamine</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/heyamine">https://www.facebook.com/heyamine</a><br /><br />Vevo <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/vevo">http://facebook.com/vevo</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/vevo">http://twitter.com/vevo</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/vevo">http://instagram.com/vevo</a><br /><br />Executive Producer: Micah Bickham<br />Director: Skyler Brown<br />Producer: Averi Smith<br />Director of Photography: Skyler Brown<br />Editor: Andrew Ros<br />Music &amp; Talent: Cynthia Todd + Sam Mackoff<br /><br />#Aminé #Charmander #Ctrl<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vevo.ly/hWJJE1">http://vevo.ly/hWJJE1</a>{% endraw %}
