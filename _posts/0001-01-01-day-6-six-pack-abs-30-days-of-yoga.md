{% raw %}Join Adriene on Day 6 of The 30 Days of Yoga journey! Six Pack Abs! Yogi style. This is a shorter practice to tone the abdominals in a mindful way that feels fun and supportive! Also, almost everyone wants more core strength and tone abdominals. You asked for it!<br />Use this Day 6 practice to check in with the core. Mindful core training will support your entire practice and whole-body health. While tone abs are something we all fancy (me too) core strength training is so much more than washboard abs or a flat tummy. By building core strength you are supporting the back and all of the muscles that surround your dear spinal cord. By working those muscles we are taking some of our weight off the spine and engaging the entire body. We are more likely to do active, engaging things when the body is strong &amp; engaged. Great for runners, dancers, movers and shakers! Great for grounding the spirit.  <br /><br />Connect and support others down below! Cultivate positivity. Remember each day is different! The journey is the reward! See you tomorrow!<br /><br />- - - - - -<br />Need the BASICS of Foundations of a pose?<br />Check out the Foundations Of Yoga playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/Bc2iUc">http://goo.gl/Bc2iUc</a><br /><br />#yogawithadriene   #freeyoga   #30daysofyoga<br />  <br />- - - - - - - - - - <br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏èSUBSCRIBE to the YWA channel for free yoga videos every week and to support high-quality free yoga for all! ‚ù§Ô∏è<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - <br /><br />üßòüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èBecome a FWFG YOGA member! üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßòüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fwfg.com">https://fwfg.com</a><br />Join Find What Feels Good and access over 700 videos including yoga and meditation for all levels.
