{% raw %}Average Net Worth By Age (Not What You'd Think)<br /><br />Most of us don’t have an eye-popping net worth like the famous investor Warren Buffett or the CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk. Just because you’re not that wealthy doesn’t mean it’s pointless to know your personal net worth. In fact, it can be a pretty helpful tool that many people fail to utilize. Knowing how much money you have is beneficial because you can keep track of your progress and see improvements over time. It’s also nice to know how yours stacks up to your peers, not for the sake of competition but just to know how you’re doing compared to the average person. These are the average net worths by age from the Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Consumer Finances so you can see how yours compares. Watch to the end to see the best ways to increase your net worth so you can easily surpass the average person.{% endraw %}
