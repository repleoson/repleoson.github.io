Gee, thanks, just bought it<br />I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it<br />I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it<br />You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it<br />I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no &quot;Mrs.&quot;<br />Bought matching diamonds for six of my b***es<br />I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches<br />Think retail therapy my new addiction<br />Whoever said money can't solve your problems<br />Must not have had enough money to solve 'em<br />They say, &quot;Which one?&quot; I say, &quot;Nah, I want all of 'em&quot;<br />Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus]<br />My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')<br />The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)<br />I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)<br />Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it<br />I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)<br />You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)<br />I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)<br /><br />[Verse 3]<br />Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers<br />If it ain't money, then wrong number<br />Black card is my business card<br />The way it be settin' the tone for me<br />I don't mean to brag, but I be like, &quot;Put it in the bag,&quot; yeah<br />When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah<br />Shoot, go from the store to the booth<br />Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot<br />Never mind, I got a juice<br />Nothing but net when we shoot<br />Look at my neck, look at my jet<br />Ain't got enough money to pay me respect<br />Ain't no budget when I'm on the set<br />If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)<br />I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)<br />You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it<br />I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)<br /><br />.........<br />üì∑ Wallpaper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unsplash.com/">https://unsplash.com/</a><br />.........<br />üìßContact: monstafluffmusicnetwork@gmail.com<br />.........<br /><br />#ArianaGrande #7rings #Lyrics{% endraw %}
