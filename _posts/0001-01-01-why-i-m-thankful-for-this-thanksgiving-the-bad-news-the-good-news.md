Although made for adults, the show is Family friendly, positivity focused, and meant to be an escape from the every day stress. Part media, part documentary, part travel show. Have an adventure with us! <br /><br />Whether its amazing educational destinations like the mysterious 1,000 year old ruins of Chaco Canyon, or the beauty of the National Parks, a Medieval Castle in France, or An Epic Journey along Route 66, there‚Äôs a lot to see! We also visit Disney World, Disneyland, Knott‚Äôs Berry Farm, and many other theme parks (like the Enchanted Forest!) offering a historical look and a practical guide to having a fun adventure! But really, the point of Randomland is that Adventure is everywhere! From the local antique store to the Las Vegas Strip, from the creepy Clown Motel in the desert to Disneyland Paris! For the better part of a decade and with well over 1,000 episodes, Randomland has been bringing families a little escape and a little dose of positivity, humor, and adventure, all free on YouTube and supported by the fans primarily through Patreon, to avoid sponsors and clickbait, and keep the RANDOM in Randomland and the Family Friendly and educational elements strong! Thanks again for watching, and if you‚Äôre new here check out some of our amazing past adventures ! And stay tuned for more, from Randomland!{% endraw %}
