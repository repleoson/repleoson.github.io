{% raw %}Hikaru's premoving the s**t out of the 800s in The Bullet Matrix Speedrun Part 3. Hikaru's retiring from recreational bullet play online and is doing so with one last Bullet Speedrun. Watch him stomp his way from scrub level (500) to as high as he can go, maybe 3200?? Should be fun!<br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCweCc7bSMX5J4jEH7HFImng/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCweCc7bSMX5J4jEH7HFImng/join</a><br /><br />🍪 Upgrade your chess game at chess.com by getting your premium membership here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.chess.com/hikaru">https://go.chess.com/hikaru</a> - you'll be supporting the channel and learning endgames like a champ!<br /><br />🎁 Or you can give the gift of chess.
