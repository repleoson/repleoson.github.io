{% raw %}Hello everyone! This is Dr. Kim! This week, we had a patient in our office that had gone over two years without getting his nails cut! Due to a few other varying health issues, he has had a difficult time maintaining his nail length and we are encouraging him to come in every few months to trim them to avoid this in the future. Stay tuned until the end for the final result!
