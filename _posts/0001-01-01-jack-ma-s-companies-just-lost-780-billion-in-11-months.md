Jack Ma is part of a small group of individuals who have been able to create companies with a total market cap of over $1 trillion. Even industry leaders like Elon Musk have yet to reach this milestone. But, over the past year, Alibaba and the Ant Group have gotten crushed by the CCP through strict regulation, unfavorable policies, and bans. The Americans have also threatened Chinese companies with delisting which has only fueled the downward spiral even further. All of these factors have caused Jack's companies' stocks to get annihilated with his companies being down well over 50% since the peak. The CCP is looking to make Jack Ma an example as to what will happen if anyone oversteps their bounds and opposed the CCP. This video explains the downfall of Jack ma and what happened to Jack Ma. <br /><br />Discord Community: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/SJUNWNt">https://discord.gg/SJUNWNt</a><br /><br />Timestamps: <br />0:00 - Jack’s Companies Lost $780 Billion<br />0:45 - Stepping Out Of Place<br />2:35 - Crushing The Ant Group<br />4:57 - Demolishing Jack’s Other Assets<br />6:32 - American Crackdown<br />7:56 - Final Takedown<br /><br />Thumbnail Credits: <br />Bobby Yip<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2XG3wY2">https://bit.ly/2XG3wY2</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bbc.in/3kAQQdT">https://bbc.in/3kAQQdT</a><br /><br />Resources: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/grhqZysn">https://pastebin.com/grhqZysn</a>{% endraw %}
