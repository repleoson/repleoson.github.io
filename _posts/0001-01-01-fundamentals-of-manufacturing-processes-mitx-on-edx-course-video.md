{% raw %}Learn the technologies used to manufacture products we use every day, and the fundamental principles required to take processes to scale<br /><br />Take this course on edX: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.edx.org/course/fundamentals-manufacturing-processes-mitx-2-008x">https://www.edx.org/course/fundamentals-manufacturing-processes-mitx-2-008x</a><br /><br />About this course<br />Have you wondered how something was manufactured? Do you want to learn what it takes to turn your design into a finished product? This course introduces a wide range of manufacturing processes including machining, injection molding, and 3D printing; and explains the fundamental principles and practices of manufacturing at scale.<br /><br />For each process, 2.008x explains the underlying physical principles, provides several practical examples and demonstrations, and summarizes design for manufacturing principles. Lectures are also included on cost estimation, quality and variation, robotics, and sustainability. Together, this knowledge will enable you to plan a manufacturing process for a multi-part product, make quantitative estimates of cost and throughput, and recognize important constraints and tradeoffs.<br /><br />Whether you may be an engineer, entrepreneur, or from another fieldâ€”by completing 2.008x you will gain the understanding needed to assess a wide variety of manufacturing techniques, identify potential improvements, and confidently pursue the scale-up of innovative products.<br /><br />What you'll learn<br />Manufacturing processes in detail: machining, injection molding, casting, thermoforming, sheet metal forming, 3D printing, and more<br />Overarching principles: rate, quality, cost, flexibility, sustainability<br />How to apply design for manufacturing principles, plan a multi-step process, and envision an automated manufacturing system for complex products<br />Emerging technologies including robotics, connected machines, and their implications on the future of manufacturing{% endraw %}
