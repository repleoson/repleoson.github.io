{% raw %}This is an abandoned lighthouse on the Greek island of Lemnos. The surrounding ruins show that the structure seen, was part of a larger structure, that initially was a normal lighthouse. After successive alterations a metal structure (light) was put in place, leading to its final decommissioning. Mixed feelings emerge...<br />P.S.
