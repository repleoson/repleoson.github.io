It’s all we can think about, every text and every date creates goosebumps all over our bodies. But over time that excitement starts to wear off. That shiny new relationship begins to lose its shine and we can’t help but think, is there someone better out there? The important part to remember is that not everything that glitters is always going to be gold. Whatever the problems are right now, doesn’t mean they’ll magically go away with someone else. There will always be plenty of options, but love is not what you can get, it’s about appreciating what you already have. If you’re always looking for the next best thing, then you’ll never see what’s right in front of you.<br /><br />💥 Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE to my channel by clicking here ➞ ➞ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/DharMannYouTube">http://bit.ly/DharMannYouTube</a> **Make sure you click the bell icon so you can get notifications when my next video goes up so you don’t miss anything! <br /><br />FOLLOW ME: life tips, relationship tips, business tips, plus much more!
