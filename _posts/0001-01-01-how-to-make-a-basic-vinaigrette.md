{% raw %}Every home cook should know how to make a basic vinaigrette dressing.  It's about as easy as easy can be and tastes way better than any store bought dressing (and there are no mystery ingredients!).<br /><br />It also works well as chicken marinade when you're in a pinch.<br /><br />I like my vinaigrette bright and tangy, and this recipe is just that.
