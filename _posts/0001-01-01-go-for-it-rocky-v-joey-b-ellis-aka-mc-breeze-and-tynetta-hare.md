{% raw %}One of my two videos from the Rocky V movie. Finally, after all of my underground Philly hip hop adventures, Louis Burrell, MC Hammer and Sylvester Stallone gave me the chance to tour 13 countries and 33 cities in Europe and Japan. Thanks to all my European fans. Sorry I've been away so long.<br />Big ups To Tynetta James Early Mike Elliot on this track.<br />Joey B Ellis AKA MC Breeze{% endraw %}
