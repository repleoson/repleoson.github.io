{% raw %}A Mentalist Guide to Social Interaction | Tom Indigo | TEDxBismarck <br /><br />Tom shares three life hacks which are key to building good habits for social interaction. He shares that these tricks will help in every aspect of life because people interact with others in everyday life. Thomas Grudzinski works as a software developer at FAST Enterprises, but is known by many as Tom Indigo: Mentalist. Tom first began performing magic in 2009 in Chicago, the birthplace of close-up magic. Shortly thereafter, he focused his attention to mentalism, the art of reading and influencing thoughts through psychology, intuition, and social interaction. <br /><br />Tom graduated from Northwestern University in 2017 with a triple major in Mathematics, Economics, and Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences. During his time as an undergrad he cofounded the Northwestern Magic Club and taught its members how to thrive in social interactions and create magical experiences for anybody they meet. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
