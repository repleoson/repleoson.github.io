{% raw %}Author Randy Street visits Google's Mountain View, CA office to discuss his book Who: The A Method for Hiring. This event took place on October 30, 2008, as a part of the Authors@Google series. <br /><br /><br /><br />In this landmark book, Geoff Smart and Randy Street provide a simple, practical, and effective solution to what The Economist calls the single biggest problem in business today: unsuccessful hiring. The average hiring mistake costs a company $1.5 million or more a year and countless wasted hours. This statistic becomes even more startling when you consider that the typical hiring success rate of managers is only 50 percent.<br /><br /><br /><br />The silver lining is that who problems are easily preventable. Based on more than 1,300 hours of interviews with more than 20 billionaires and 300 CEOs, Who presents Smart and Streets A Method for Hiring. Refined through the largest research study of its kind ever undertaken, the A Method stresses fundamental elements that anyone can implement-and it has a 90 percent success rate.<br /><br /><br /><br />Randy Street is the president of ghSMART Executive Learning and a top-rated international public speaker.{% endraw %}
