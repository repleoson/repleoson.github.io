{% raw %}Taiwan’s foreign minister says that Taiwan is preparing for war with China. In an interview with Australian Broadcasting Corporation, foreign minister Joseph Wu asked likeminded nations like Australia to expand intelligence sharing and security cooperation with Taiwan.<br /><br />Joseph Wu<br />Foreign minister<br />If China is going to launch a war against Taiwan, we will fight to the end, and that is our commitment.<br /><br />Lin Ting-hui<br />Taiwanese Society of International Law<br />Actually what Minister Joseph Wu is explaining to Australia is that – what he mainly wanted to do is show that the people of Taiwan have the will and the ability to defend themselves, unlike Afghanistan. Say that Australia’s defense policy is armed by U.S. weapons, and it has the ability to provide support in the Taiwan Strait. In such a case, Taiwan’s resolve to defend itself would, of course, make Australia more confident in Taiwan and more determined to provide support.<br /><br />During his interview with ABC, the foreign minister said he welcomed the establishment of a U.K., U.S. and Australia security pact in September. The defense deal, called AUKUS, will allow Australia to build nuclear-powered submarines using American technology.{% endraw %}
