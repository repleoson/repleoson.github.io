{% raw %}Belgian &quot;punk&quot; band of the early 1980's. Sharp, witty lyrics. Sharp witty graphics. Sharp, witty sound. Their range of styles varied from ska to punk to pop music. Their debut single &quot;Pick it up&quot;, immediately became an underground hit (over 5,000 copies, which was a lot those days) and led them to the final of the Rock Rally edition 1980. In Wit-Lof from Belgium, the song was described as being &quot;ska at the speed of sound&quot;. The Offspring, a renound American punk band in the nineties, would later incorportate a lot of ideas from &quot;Pick it up&quot; into their song &quot;Don't Pick it up&quot; on the cd &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot;, but it didn't came to a lawsuit.{% endraw %}
