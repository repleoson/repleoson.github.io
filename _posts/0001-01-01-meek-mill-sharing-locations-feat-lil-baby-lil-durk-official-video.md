And my man in the can while you taking out the trash he pop up with the mac like don’t run<br /> <br />Baby:  Gave her a pill they all get high, you ever had a foursome?  Its too much cash for me to hide, I had to give little bro some. I fuck her raw from time to time, I don’t show no emotion<br /> <br />Durk: But when he died he had them racks, he had to make a go fund. I hang with the hitters who train the killers, who send all the niggas on slow runs. I got me a check, and I bought me a cat and went on the block and did donuts. I hang with all the Murderers, I’m paying all the lawyers for the Murderers, I’m putting all my dice on the Murderers, you don’t winna see me with the Murderers, Murderers<br /> <br />Meek:  Rolls Royce swervin, famous bitch curvin, seen you out in traffic, you was looking nervous<br /> <br />Baby: Ran it up on accident, then they thought it was on purpose, I know for a fact I’m blasting mine I never get too worried. Hundred racks in hundreds stick like cursive I been selling verses.<br /> <br />Durk: One time I lied inside my song, I ain’t gonna buy no Burkin. Homicide on my mind when I slide I ain’t trying see no hearse. He ain’t even die by the gun; took a fake pill nigga died off percs<br /> <br />Meek:  Shorty look perfect, pussy was worth it, go get her some purses, My diamonds be hitting like we in a Versus, we sticking together this shit in a cursive. I’m fuckin with Durkio, I just left the jeweler with Baby bought two anniversaries. Go to Atlanta to Copper Cove me, bad little bitches all on me. Way to ranked up, ain’t no exposing me.   She wanna go to the mall, got up and went to the pop up at Louis in Soho and ordered it all. I’m in this bitch with the voice and the hero these niggas is weirdos, ain’t going this hard. I’m from the P, that’s gang. All these niggas know me I hang with…<br /> <br />Durk: I hang with all the Murderers, I’m paying all the lawyers for the Murderers, I’m putting all my dice on the Murderers, you don’t wanna see me with the Murderers, Murderers{% endraw %}
