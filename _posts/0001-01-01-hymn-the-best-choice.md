I will never weep!<br /> Trash, refuse, that’s what they are!<br /> From me, oh, they better stay afar. <br />My life of ease I now count as loss, <br />You I will acquire at all cost!<br /><br />CHORUS: <br />I made the best choice when I said, “I love You! <br />Lord, You’re my treasure of great value! <br />Now all things are absolutely nothing, <br />Because to me, You are my everything! <br />My future, my life, no longer my own, <br />All I present for Your recovery. <br />Until the age’s consummation, <br />Full-time, lifetime, I will serve You!”<br /><br />(2) Lord, now my eyes clearly see Your need,<br /> My desire to serve is burning indeed! <br />To be perfected, to be trained by You, <br />This desire in me so strong, so true. <br />Not just for enjoyment that I am here, <br />For discipline, intense breaking, too.<br /> With vision clear, with You so near,<br /> O my Lord, oh, until death ensue!<br /> I will remain though others treat me sore,<br /> I dare not from You ask for more!<br /><br />(3) Lord, I to Your demand say “Amen!” <br />Though my shameful weakness is exposed. <br />I learned to put myself now to an end, <br />In my ugly self no more I boast.<br /> I am not a fool, all good things I’ve known, <br />Yet why am I still here pressing on? <br />Though I myself cannot apprehend,<br /> On You I will rest, rely, depend. <br />Will not from You my heart ever sever, <br />Yesterday, today, forever!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hymns in the Lord's Recovery Playlist<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL71GH8oOBcd1BvPScTyyqpJV2SyyTr_wd">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL71GH8oOBcd1BvPScTyyqpJV2SyyTr_wd</a><br /><br />Spanish Hymns Playlist<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL71GH8oOBcd0xioNlsjk6jTNRGkUqk9cv">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL71GH8oOBcd0xioNlsjk6jTNRGkUqk9cv</a><br /><br />1 Hour Instrumental Hymns<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL71GH8oOBcd1NYGIGJXVAiQVdJLyqoKiZ">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL71GH8oOBcd1NYGIGJXVAiQVdJLyqoKiZ</a><br /><br /><br />Howard Higashi Hymns<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL71GH8oOBcd2fjNG_u6es_CA2zv2DZn4r">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL71GH8oOBcd2fjNG_u6es_CA2zv2DZn4r</a><br /><br /><br />Instrumental Hymns Playlist<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL71GH8oOBcd3iQCvRIAWKGVdonCDrpSWR">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL71GH8oOBcd3iQCvRIAWKGVdonCDrpSWR</a><br /><br /><br />#HymnsintheLordsrecovery<br />#SpiritualSongs<br />#HymnStream<br />#BibleSongs<br /><br /><br /><br />DISCLAIMER:  I do not own the song in this video.
