{% raw %}We prefer people who are ‘straightforward’: who are direct and unambiguous about their desires and characters.

There is therefore no need to guess, infer, decode, untangle, unscramble or translate. There are no sudden surprises or revolutions in perspective. If these straightforward types don’t want to do something, they will, politely and in good time, explain that it’s really not for them. If they’re unhappy with our behaviour, they won’t smile sweetly while developing noxious stores of envy or hatred in the recesses of their minds; they will immediately provide a gentle but accurate statement of how we are frustrating them. If they are worried a project is going awry, they won’t pretend that all is well until a catastrophe can no longer be denied. If they are attracted to someone, they will find charming, kind and inoffensive ways of making their feelings clear. And in bed, they may want to please, but they can also be honest and unashamed about what actually excites them.”<br /><br /><br />MORE SCHOOL OF LIFE<br /><br />Watch more films on SELF in our playlist: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/TSOLself">http://bit.ly/TSOLself</a><br /><br />You can submit translations and transcripts on all of our videos here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog&amp;tab=2">https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog&amp;tab=2</a> <br />Find out how more here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6054623?hl=en-GB">https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6054623?hl=en-GB</a> <br /><br /><br />SOCIAL MEDIA<br /><br />Feel free to follow us at the links below:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/">https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/</a>  <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife">https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife</a>   <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/">https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/</a> <br /><br /><br />CREDITS<br /><br />Produced in collaboration with:<br /><br />Noelle Smith Design<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.noellesmithdesign.com/">http://www.noellesmithdesign.com/</a><br /> <br />Title animation produced in collaboration with<br /><br />Vale Productions<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.valeproductions.co.uk/">https://www.valeproductions.co.uk/</a>{% endraw %}
