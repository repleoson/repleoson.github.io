You can’t just dip-buy anything that’s crashing — that’s a recipe for disaster. You need to study the history and patterns.  <br /><br />Pay attention to the indicators when you dip-buy. Because dip-buying sucks when you ignore the indicators.<br /><br />What should you look for? Plays that are up over several days, and not affected by negative news. If the stock is down due to stop losses, that can lead to a nice bounce. <br /><br />Why do these stocks bounce? Because there are two groups of people waiting to buy on the dip: short sellers and those who missed their opportunity on the big run-up. <br /><br />Once you determine why the stock is bouncing, how do you know where the bottom is? You need to consider things like the patterns, previous support, bid stacking and level 2. And where was the stock was before its spike? <br /><br />This is not an exact science. Learn what to look for so you can be prepared! <br /><br />Do you trade morning panics? Why or why not?
