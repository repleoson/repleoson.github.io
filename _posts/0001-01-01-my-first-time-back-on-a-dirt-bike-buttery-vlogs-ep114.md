{% raw %}Only 29 days off from my shoulder separation but it still feels like I crashed just yesterday! Super stoked to be back on my dirt bike and riding with my buddies! It's not very often we get a rain in California none the less 2 days in a week so you know we had to take advantage. Bring on the cold weather and good times with the homies! Thank you to everyone who watches and supports we truly appreciate you guys!
