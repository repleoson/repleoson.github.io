More consumers are opting to return to gyms such as Planet Fitness and Equinox, or fitness junkies are purchasing another at-home option from the flurry of companies that sell everything from rowing machines to connected mirrors.<br /><br />“We anticipated fiscal 2022 would be a very challenging year to forecast, given unusual year-ago comparisons, demand uncertainty amidst re-opening economies, and widely-reported supply chain constraints and commodity cost pressures,” Chief Executive Officer John Foley said in a letter to shareholders. <br /><br />A slower-than-expected start to the second quarter and “challenged visibility” in the near term led the company to lower its expectations, Foley said. <br /><br />Here’s how Peloton did in its fiscal first quarter compared with what analysts polled by Refinitiv were expecting: <br /><br />Loss per share: $1.25 vs. $1.07 expected <br />Revenue: $805.2 million vs. $810.7 million expected<br />For the three-month period ended Sept. 30, Peloton reported a net loss of $376 million, or $1.25 per share, compared with net income of $69.3 million, or earnings of 20 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had been looking for Peloton to post a loss of $1.07 per share. <br /><br />Revenue grew 6% to $805.2 million from $757.9 million a year earlier, missing estimates for $810.7 million. <br /><br />That marked a significant slowdown from the 250% sales surge that Peloton booked in the first quarter of 2020, when consumers were eager to get their hands on at-home bikes to workout when gyms were closed. <br /><br />Sales of connected fitness products, including its Bikes and Treads, fell 17% to $501 million. Subscription revenue grew 94% to $304.1 million. Connected fitness sales accounted for 62% of Peloton’s business in the quarter. <br /><br />Peloton counted 2.49 million connected fitness subscribers at the end of the three-month period, up 87% year over year. Connected fitness subscribers are people who own a Peloton product and also pay a monthly fee to access the company’s digital workout content. <br /><br />Its entire member base, which includes digital-only subscribers, totaled 6.2 million. <br /><br />Average net monthly connected fitness churn, which Peloton uses to measure retention of connected fitness subscribers, ticked up to 0.82% from 0.73% in the prior quarter. <br /><br />Connected fitness subscribers completed 16.6 workouts per month, on average, a drop from 20.7 workouts a year earlier.<br /><br />Price cut to Bike disappoints<br /><br />Sales and marketing expenses surged 148% to $284.3 million, representing roughly 35% of revenue.<br /><br />The company has poured dollars into advertising its now less-expensive Bike product and Tread treadmill machine. The latter was just recently put back on sale in the U.S. following a widespread recall. <br /><br />In August, Peloton slashed the price of its original Bike by 20% to $1,495. On Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Jill Woodworth said that while Bike sales accelerated after the change, the results haven’t entirely met Peloton’s expectations.<br /><br />“While the price drop led to conversion rates that exceeded our forecast, overall traffic has not met our initial expectation,” Woodworth told analysts on an earnings call. “We’ve also seen a richer than anticipated mix of Bike sales versus Bike+, further impacting both revenue and our growth margin expectation.”<br /><br />» Subscribe to CNBC TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic</a> <br /><br />Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.
