{% raw %}My 3rd video is all about appreciating God's love for us as He died on the cross to save our souls and how we are lucky to have Him as our creator, mentor and saviour. I omitted some verses and put it in here that i love to read in the bible. And i hope you may have time to read it because it's beautiful.<br /><br />&quot;Give thanks to the God of heaven. His love endures forever&quot; (Psalm 136:26).<br /><br />note* Still is Hillsong United's music. I dont own them. the pictures i put together was from google search engine and from Jesus Daily on Facebook. I made this video to praise and worship the Lord.<br /><br />Thank you for watching and go spread the words too. ♥♫♥{% endraw %}
