{% raw %}Elvis Presley Take Good Care of her Lyrics: (Words &amp; music by Warren - Kent) Take good care of her, take good care of her I suppose I ought to say congratulations For you won the only girl I ever loved But I hurt too much to face the situation Just take good care of her, take good care of her Just to be around her was my greatest pleasure [ Find more Lyrics on www.mp3lyrics.org/Qtb ] She was everything my future held in store So remember when you take my only treasure Just take good care of her, take good care of her I must accept it, she loves you more than me So with my broken heart I'll bow out gracefully Please don't send me any wedding invitation For I couldn't bear to see her there with you If she's happy, that will be my consolation Just take good care of her, take good care of her Take good care of her, take good care of her Lyrics: Take Good Care of her, Elvis Presley [end]{% endraw %}
