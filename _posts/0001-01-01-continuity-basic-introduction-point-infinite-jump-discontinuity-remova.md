{% raw %}This calculus video tutorial provides a basic introduction into to continuity.  It explains the difference between a continuous function and a discontinuous one.  It discusses the difference between a jump discontinuity, an infinite discontinuity and a point discontinuity.  A point discontinuity is a hole also known as a removable discontinuity.  Infinite and jump discontinuities are nonremovable discontinuities.  This video explains how to identify the points of discontinuity in a rational function and in a piecewise function.  it explains how to make piecewise functions continuous by finding the value of the constant.  This video has many examples and practice problems.<br /><br />My Website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.video-tutor.net">https://www.video-tutor.net</a><br />Patreon Donations:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor">https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor</a><br />Amazon Store:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/theorganicchemistrytutor">https://www.amazon.com/shop/theorganicchemistrytutor</a><br /><br />Subscribe:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWpbFLzoYGPfuWUMFPSaoA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWpbFLzoYGPfuWUMFPSaoA?sub_confirmation=1</a>{% endraw %}
