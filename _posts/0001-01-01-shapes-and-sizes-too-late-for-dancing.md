{% raw %}Enjoy. <br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />I can't remember<br />The moment I fell<br />I'm tucked in the moment nice and tight<br />To keep my head down on<br />The ground<br />We shoot way the flashlight<br />We laid in your back<br />We used a necktie as a lasso<br />To pull my body off the ground<br /><br />And it's too late for dancing, too early to rise<br />Please lay me down and cover my eyes<br />And it's too late for dancing, too early to rise<br />Please lay me down and cover my eyes<br /><br />Hold up my left arm<br />Hold up my right<br />Let me go on for two days more<br />Before you plea me whole tonight<br />I saw on TV once<br />Sticks through their breasts<br />They hung there for seven centuries or more<br />Before the rest discovered the West<br /><br />And it's too late for dancing, too early to rise<br />Please lay me down and cover my eyes<br />And it's too late for dancing, too early to rise<br />Please lay me down and cover my eyes{% endraw %}
