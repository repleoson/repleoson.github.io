In this third one, I show you how *reduce* fits into your toolbox and a basic example of it's usage. <br />Code from the video here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jsfiddle.net/mattiasjle/w789neex/">https://jsfiddle.net/mattiasjle/w789neex/</a><br /><br />How to install and use io.js (for the arrow functions example)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://davidwalsh.name/es6-io">http://davidwalsh.name/es6-io</a><br /><br />You want to follow me on Twitter and Quora:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mpjme">https://twitter.com/mpjme</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.quora.com/Mattias-Petter-Johansson">http://www.quora.com/Mattias-Petter-Johansson</a><br /><br />💛 Follow on Twitch <br />We record the show live Mondays 7 AM PT<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/funfunfunction">https://twitch.tv/funfunfunction</a><br /><br />💛 Fun Fun Forum<br />Private discussion forum with other viewers in between shows. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.funfunforum.com.">https://www.funfunforum.com.</a> Available to patron members, become one at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/funfunfunction">https://www.patreon.com/funfunfunction</a><br /><br />💛 mpj on Twitter<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mpjme">https://twitter.com/mpjme</a><br /><br />💛 CircleCI (Show sponsor)<br />Robust and sleek Docker-based Continuous Integration as a service.

Most coding content out there focus on step-by-step tutorials. We think tutorials are too far removed from what everyday development is like. Instead, FFF has created a completely new learning environment where we grow from failure, by solving problems while intensively interacting with a live audience. <br /><br />Tutorials try to solve a problem. Failing Together makes you grow as a developer and coworker.<br /><br />📹 Each show is recorded live on Twitch in a 2-hour livestream on Mondays. The host, assisted by the audience, is tasked to complete a programming challenge by an expert guest. Like in the real world, we often fail, and learn from it. This, of course, reflects what the audience identifies with, and is one of the most praised aspects of the show. <br /><br />⏯ On Fridays, an edited version of the show is adapted for and published on YouTube. <br /><br />Content Topics revolve around: JavaScript, Functional Programming, Software Architecture, Quality Processes, Developer Career and Health, Software Development, Project Management{% endraw %}
