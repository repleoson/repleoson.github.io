{% raw %}Freshman Organic Chemistry II (CHEM 125B)<br /><br /><br /><br />After drill on the mechanism of the pinacol rearrangement, this lecture applies molecular-orbital analysis to simultaneous electrophilic/nucleophilic attack by a single atom to form a three-membered ring from an alkene.  These reactions provide drill in consistent use of the curved-arrow formalism for describing electron-pair shifts.  Two alternative mechanisms for formation of cyclopropanes by the alkylzinc Simmons-Smith &quot;carbenoid&quot; reagent are proposed, and the one-step mechanism is supported by theory.  Epoxidation of alkenes by peroxycarboxylic acids also seems to go by way of a concerted electrophilic/nucleophilic process involving a single transition state.  The stereochemistry and scale of various paths to epoxides is discussed in the context of their commercial utility.<br /><br /><br /><br />00:00 - Chapter 1.
