{% raw %}This meditation music guides you into a mindful meditation experience. It will help you to look within yourself to help you discover and learn more about your habits, tendencies, predispositions, and more. Self-reflection may be challenging for some people, but it is important to understand the framework you are working within. When you can organize these thoughts, you will begin taking appropriate actions, which will result in personal development and help put you on a successful and positive trajectory. These brainwaves are the slowest of all and are defined as having a pulse modulation frequency range between 0-4 Hz. We experience these brainwaves naturally when we are in the deepest of sleep or meditative states. These brainwaves send signals throughout the body to promote healthy neurochemistry and, as a result, are vital in the maintenance of psychological well-being. <br /><br />This meditation music is based upon the theory of neural entrainment. This is the theory that our brains have a tendency to synchronize themselves to external stimulation, which could include auditory, visual, tactile, or electromagnetic stimuli. The average human brain contains approximately 80+ billion neurons that communicate to form our thoughts, emotions, and behavior. When our neurons communicate in mass, it produces a synchronized electrical pulse known as a brainwave. With the use of neural entrainment, our brainwaves can align with these auditory stimuli. As a result, we can stimulate our neurons and brains in ways that could positively affect our psychology and physiology.
