{% raw %}SORT OF, from creators Bilal Baig (Acha Bacha) and Fab Filippo (Save Me), is a big-hearted dramatic comedy about Sabi Mehboob (Baig), a fluid millennial who straddles various identities from sexy bartender at an LGBTQ bookstore/bar, to the youngest child in a large Pakistani family, to the de facto parent of a downtown hipster family. <br /><br />Catch the series Tuesday, October 5 on CBC Gem and Tuesday, November 9 on CBC TV with back-to-back episodes starting at 9 p.m. (9:30 NT).<br /><br />In SORT OF, Sabi feels like they’re in transition in every aspect of their life, from gender to love to sexuality to family to career. When Sabi’s best friend 7ven (Amanda Cordner) presents them with an opportunity to live and find themself in the &quot;queerest place in the galaxy,&quot; Sabi instead makes the decision to stay and care for the kids they nanny after their mom has a serious bike accident. Do they regret it? Sort of. A coming-of-age story, Sort Of exposes the labels we once poured ourselves into as no longer applicable...to anyone.<br /><br />A CBC original series, SORT OF is produced by Sienna Films/Sphere Media and created by Bilal Baig and Fab Filippo, who also serve as showrunners and executive producers. The series is written by Baig, Filippo, Jenn Engels, Nelu Handa and Ian Iqbal Rashid, with Filippo and Renuka Jeyapalan (Kim’s Convenience, Workin’ Moms) directing. Sienna Films’ Jennifer Kawaja and Julia Sereny are also executive producers. <br /><br />Subscribe for more comedy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/subscribeCBCcomedy">http://bit.ly/subscribeCBCcomedy</a><br /><br />Follow CBC Comedy:<br />On Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/CBCComedy">http://www.twitter.com/CBCComedy</a><br />On Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/cbccomedy">http://www.facebook.com/cbccomedy</a><br />On Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/cbccomedy">http://www.instagram.com/cbccomedy</a><br /><br />CBC Comedy is your destination for funny Canadian comedy and comedians in Canada, clips from TV shows like Schitt's Creek, Workin' Moms, Baroness von Sketch, Tallboyz and more!<br /><br />#sortof #trailer #cbc{% endraw %}
