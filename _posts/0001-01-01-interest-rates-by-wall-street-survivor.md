{% raw %}What are interest rates?<br />Get a FREE STOCK with Robinhood: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/FreeStockRHWSS">http://bit.ly/FreeStockRHWSS</a><br />OUR TOP RATED STOCK NEWSLETTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2MpHkM9">http://bit.ly/2MpHkM9</a><br /><br />Interest rates, however, are important to understand because of their profound effects on your stock portfolio and your ability to buy a house. This impact is so significant that the chairman of the Fed Reserve is probably the second most powerful person in the country after the President.<br /><br />Interest rates generally refer to the general level of interest that a borrower has to pay a lender to borrow a certain amount of money for a certain amount of time. These rates refer to all sorts of loans, ranging from ones companies take to buy new machines, to ones you or I would take to buy a new house.  Although these loans can be used by very different borrowers for very different purposes, their overall levels generally rise and fall together. Think of a rising tide lifting all boats in the water, regardless of whether itâ€™s a tanker or a rowboat. Intuitively, high interest rates dissuade people from borrowing because it becomes more expensive to do so.<br /><br />AFFILIATE DISCLOSURE: Some of the links on this webpage are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Wall Street Survivor may earn a commission if you sign up with one of our affiliates.
