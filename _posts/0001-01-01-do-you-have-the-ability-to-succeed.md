{% raw %}Welcome To The Why Factor Academy,<br /><br />Most people have the ability to quit rather than the ability to succeed.<br /><br />Quitability. Does that word exist? I don't think it's in the dictionary, but it's a word that I'm very used to, and that is the ability to quit. Sometimes we don't need to figure it all out, but we just need to get started. In this video I will give you guidance on how to be the best you that you can be - just don't quit!<br />Nobody is better than you. They may be ahead of you, but they aren’t better than you.<br /><br />Are you happy? Has the world seen the best of you? Or do you have more to give? <br />Have You Got The Why Factor, is a book written by successful author and entrepreneur Ayo Olaseinde. This book is Ayo’s personal story of learning from both successes and failures and using them to achieve considerable success. <br /><br />Through the life lessons of Ayo, you will learn how to achieve a healthy, successful and positive lifestyle. In order to become successful within the Why Factor, you need to remain open-minded and willing to learn. <br />The Why Factor derives from a characteristic within us that has been around since the beginning of mankind; asking the “why?” question. <br /><br />By re-introducing the question “why?” in a positive manner into our daily lives, we can develop a better understanding of life and learn to build a happier, positive and more successful way of life. The Why Factor Academy, developed by Ayo Olaseinde, will empower you and teach you the fundamental skills to help you on your own journey to be the best you that you can be. <br /><br /><br />_____<br /><br />View Our Other YouTube Channels:<br />The Why Factor Academy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFactorAcademy">https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFactorAcademy</a><br />The Truth About Success: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheTruthAboutSuccessAyoOlaseinde">https://www.youtube.com/c/TheTruthAboutSuccessAyoOlaseinde</a><br />Why Not Me Meditation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv7Ba9Ibq3HDQ-ho1aLrZ7Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv7Ba9Ibq3HDQ-ho1aLrZ7Q</a><br /><br />Instagram:<br />AyoOlaseinde: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ayoolaseinde/">https://www.instagram.com/ayoolaseinde/</a><br /><br />Facebook:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AyoOlaseinde.page">https://www.facebook.com/AyoOlaseinde.page</a><br /><br />_____<br /><br /><br />FAIR-USE COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER<br /><br />*Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
