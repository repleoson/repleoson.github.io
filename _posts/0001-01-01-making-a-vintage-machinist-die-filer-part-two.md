{% raw %}PART ONE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Vsq8L3nHyRc">https://youtu.be/Vsq8L3nHyRc</a><br /><br />G'day everyone,<br /><br /> I am starting a new project that will take up the next few videos on this channel. I am making a vintage style bench top filing machine/ die filer. These little machines are great for precise work where small parts need to be filed and the cut needing to be perpendicular to the work. <br /><br />These machines are once very common, but are much less common nowadays, due t a move towards CNC machines. There are no commercial options as far as I am aware, and the few that you can but come as a kit that you self assemble using cast iron castings. I had looked into this option, but freight costs to my part of the world put it outside of my budget.<br /><br />I am making a die filer using some cast iron and mild steel, machining it using my mill and lathe. In this video I machine the base, vertical column, horizontal column and bushings/plain bearings.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Lathe: Sieg C3 7x14 mini lathe<br />Mill: Sieg x2.7l Mini Mill<br /><br />#machining #DIY #workshop{% endraw %}
