{% raw %}Frequently I am asked about which fig variety I've grown that tastes the best... ROSS, which fig is the best tasting though?! Which has the best flavor? What's your #1??<br />Perhaps on a yearly basis my answers will be similar, but if you're looking at this question on a daily basis, the answer will vary every single day. <br /><br />IF I had a plate of figs in front me, (which is not uncommon from August-October) the best tasting fig of the day would be pretty much different every day. Why? Because usually the best tasting fig on that particular day is almost always the one that's the most ripe. It's usually the fig that shrivels and has dried fruit flavors or the one that has its insides turn into full blown jam, etc... So even if I had a Black Madeira fig in front of me, if it's not ripe enough, something else on that day is going to beat it. Yeah.. maybe the best tasting Black Madeira I ripen is better than the best tasting Azores Dark I ripen, but how often does that realistically happen? Not very often. This video really writes my point home about why we should not be focusing on what fig tastes the best at its prime, but instead, which one consistently tastes the best on a daily or weekly basis.<br /><br />Zone 7A - Greater Philadelphia<br />Website &amp; Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.figboss.com/">https://www.figboss.com/</a><br />The Fruit Talk!
