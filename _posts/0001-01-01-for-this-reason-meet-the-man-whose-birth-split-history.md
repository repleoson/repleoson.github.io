{% raw %}Adapted from the 222-minute KING of GLORY movie, FOR THIS REASON takes you on a 100-minute, eye-opening ride through the world’s best seller – from earth’s creation to history’s climax. <br /><br />To abridge the 15-episode KING of GLORY movie, more than 50 vital stories and teachings had to be cut. So what’s left? A one-sitting, dot-connecting expedition into the ancient scriptures of the prophets, which point to the One who said, “FOR THIS REASON I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.” (Gospel of John 18.37)<br /><br />While this chronological retelling of history’s core story is perfect for Christmastime, it’s a film for all seasons and all people, including those who don’t celebrate Christmas.<br /><br />Take the ride. Meet the Man whose birth split world history in two.<br /><br />Trailer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/4h7VzoAy2LU">https://youtu.be/4h7VzoAy2LU</a>   <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rockintl.org/for-this-reason">https://rockintl.org/for-this-reason</a>  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rockintl.org/king-of-glory">https://rockintl.org/king-of-glory</a> <br />2021©ROCK International{% endraw %}
