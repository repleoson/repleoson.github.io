Even though I now have more money and a greater income than the vast majority of society, there are still a lot of things many people spend money on, that I've cut out of my life.<br /><br />You may have a thought that when you get rich, it'll be all dollar-dollar bills, and that there will be no limits to the simple things in life that you'll keep spending money on. Well for me, I've found the opposite. There are probably more things today that I don't buy, when compared to when I was relatively financially unsuccessful.<br /><br />My insights will hopefully help you on your financial journey, help you save more, and succeed faster.<br /><br />Please enjoy!<br /><br />0:00 - Van-life intro<br />1:30 - Low nutritional food<br />2:54 - Fast fashion (and other disposable items)<br />4:52 - Eating out constantly<br />6:49 - Expensive toys<br />7:33 - Big homes<br />9:32 - Brand new cars<br />10:44 - Excess things<br />12:14 - Freedom is different for everyone<br />12:54 - A little outro<br /><br />‚ñ∫ IMPORTANT LINKS:<br />Enter your email below for free weekly lessons and insights into becoming financially free, investing, global tax and corporate structures, passports, residencies, and more.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.abundantia.co/">https://www.abundantia.co/</a><br /><br />‚ñ∫ SOCIAL MEDIA:<br />‚Ä¢ Abundantia Instagram: @abundantia.co <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/">https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/</a><br />‚Ä¢ Sorelle's Instagram: @sorelleamore  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/sorelleamore">https://instagram.com/sorelleamore</a><br />‚Ä¢ Abundantia Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/abundantiaco">https://twitter.com/abundantiaco</a><br />‚Ä¢ Abundantia Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance">http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance</a><br /><br />Sorelle and Leon.<br />Founders, Abundantia<br /><br />Liability Disclaimer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer">https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer</a><br />*We may earn a commission if you buy any products or services via the links in this video's description.
