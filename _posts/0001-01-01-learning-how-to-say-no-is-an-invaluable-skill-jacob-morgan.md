{% raw %}Do you find that you agree to every request made by your manager? Do you say yes to every possible event and activity your friends and family invite you to? When someone approaches you to take on a new project or task do you immediately say “yes”? It can be hard to tell people no, but it is a skill we all need to learn.<br /><br />Saying yes to everything can cause burnout, stress, and frustration. It can stunt your growth as an individual and as a professional. It will overwhelm you and cause you to get behind on goals and aspirations. <br /><br />When you say no to something, you are saying yes to something else.
