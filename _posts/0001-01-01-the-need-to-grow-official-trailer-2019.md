{% raw %}Executive Produced &amp; Narrated by Rosario Dawson<br /><br />A Film by Rob Herring &amp; Ryan Wirick <br /><br />With only 60 years of farmable soil left on Earth, &quot;The Need To GROW&quot; offers an intimate look into the hearts of activists and innovators in the food movement: an 8-year-old girl challenges the ethics of a beloved organization; a renegade farmer struggles to keep his land as he revolutionizes resource efficient agriculture; and an accomplished visionary inventor faces catastrophe in the midst of developing a game-changing technology.<br /><br />&quot;The Need to GROW&quot; delivers alarming evidence on the importance of healthy soil — revealing not only the potential of localized food production working with nature, but our opportunity as individuals to help regenerate our planet’s dying soils and participate in the restoration of the Earth.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.TheNeedToGROW.com/">http://www.TheNeedToGROW.com/</a>{% endraw %}
