{% raw %}A single from my upcoming EP / Shortalbum: &quot;Smol EP&quot;<br /><br />This is the theme of chillaxing, Rainbow Dash would be proud. I've done enough dramatic and emotionally jilting musical presentations, it's time I addressed the cute factor of horse. ENJOY this preview of what is to come. // if you came here and are a non-pony listener, yes I know I'm full of cringe. Just enjoy the music if you can.<br /><br />(Also, we're all working on trying to get Cadie into producing music c: Hopefully you like her first dabblings in music making!)<br /><br />Grab the song: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vyletpony.bandcamp.com/track/ordinarily">https://vyletpony.bandcamp.com/track/ordinarily</a><br /><br />Or listen: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/da5h-records/ordinarily">https://soundcloud.com/da5h-records/ordinarily</a><br /><br />Art by my wife: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://lovelydreams14.deviantart.com/">http://lovelydreams14.deviantart.com/</a><br /><br />Composed &amp; Produced by Vylet &amp; Cadie<br />Humming by Cadie<br /><br />-----------------------------<br />Lyrics:<br /><br />*Various humming sounds*<br /><br />//<br /><br />inspired by Snail's House{% endraw %}
