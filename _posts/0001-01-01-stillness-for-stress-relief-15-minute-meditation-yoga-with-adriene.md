{% raw %}Be still, and know yourself better. In a world of constant bustle, hustle, and grind, there is still opportunity to cultivate balance and influence our experience of the world in a positive and meaningful way. This is a practice for mental health, and spiritual wellbeing - a gift for both mind and body. Stillness can be challenging, but that is why this is a practice. Join me, practice dropping in, and welcome clarity and peace now.<br /><br />This meditation session is a beautiful way to start or end your day. It is also excellent post active workout or when you may have a turbulent mind and could use a break, a breath of fresh air. <br /><br />This gentle mindfulness practice is a gift and it‚Äôs here for you. You are invited to slow down, experience peace, and just be. <br /><br />Please share with someone who you think may benefit from this peaceful practice, and let‚Äôs create a ripple from stillness together. Let me know how this practice experience goes for you in the comments! <br /><br />For more videos like this, check out:<br />Meditation for Inner Peace: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/d4S4twjeWTs">https://youtu.be/d4S4twjeWTs</a><br />Meditation for Mental Balance and Grounding: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/x0nZ1ZLephQ">https://youtu.be/x0nZ1ZLephQ</a><br />Meditation for Self Love: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/CqnWMPuyT0g">https://youtu.be/CqnWMPuyT0g</a><br />Resolve to Evolve: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DP3BE1ezThE">https://youtu.be/DP3BE1ezThE</a><br /><br />Suggested Playlist: Guided Meditations: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLui6Eyny-UzzG5qB0LNxyVh3Mu6GjYJC_">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLui6Eyny-UzzG5qB0LNxyVh3Mu6GjYJC_</a><br /><br />Key Moments: <br />0:00 Surrender to stillness intro<br />1:20 find a comfortable position<br />3:15 body scan<br />3:52 bring awareness to the breath<br />6:17 invitation back to the present moment<br />6:32 body scan<br />12:40 drop deeper into stillness<br />13:42 begin to find some small movements<br />14:30 gratitude check in<br />15:15 close the meditation, feel amazing <br /><br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - <br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏èSUBSCRIBE to the YWA channel for free yoga videos every week and to support high-quality free yoga for all! ‚ù§Ô∏è<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - <br /><br />üßòüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èBecome an FWFG YOGA member! üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßòüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.yogawithadriene.com/fwfg">https://www.yogawithadriene.com/fwfg</a><br />Join Find What Feels Good and access over 700 videos including yoga and meditation for all levels.
