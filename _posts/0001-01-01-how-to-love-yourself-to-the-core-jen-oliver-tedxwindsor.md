{% raw %}The world is a better place each time someone disconnects from their busy, bossy mind and taps into their heart and core to ignite a deeper connection to self. There is an epidemic of low self-worth on this planet that will only be remedied with one person at a time committing to expressing unwavering gratitude, compassion and reverence within. Through the heart-core connection to self-love, we can elevate our own consciousness, deepen our connections with others and contribute to the collective respect, love and peace on earth. Jen Oliver is the Author of the International best selling book, The Love FitMama Way and creator of the FitMama Podcast, the Work IN to your workout. Through safe core fitness, self-care and  mindfulness she supports moms to embrace, nurture and enjoy their motherhood journey. What she is most passionate about is spreading the message that if you love the body and life you have, you will have the body and life you love. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
