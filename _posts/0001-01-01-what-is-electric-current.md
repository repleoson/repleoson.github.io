{% raw %}When electric charges move, that's called current! In most circuits, this movement is accomplished by electrons in a conductor. As it turns out, an electron doesn't need to move very far; it can force other electrons in the conductor to move. In the video, we demonstrate moving electric charges with a tube and some metal balls. We also examine conventional current vs. electron flow and how good ol' Ben Franklin can be blamed for that bit of confusion.<br /><br />Previous episode: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qfhFXjsrw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qfhFXjsrw</a><br />Written Tutorial: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-a-circuit">https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-a-circuit</a>{% endraw %}
