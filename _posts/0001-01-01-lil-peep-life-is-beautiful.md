{% raw %}‘Come Over When You’re Sober, Pt. 2’ Out November 9: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://smarturl.it/COWYS2">http://smarturl.it/COWYS2</a> <br /> <br />“Life Is Beautiful” off ‘Come Over When You’re Sober, Pt. 2’ out now:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://smarturl.it/LPLifeIsBeautiful">http://smarturl.it/LPLifeIsBeautiful</a><br /><br />LIZA’S NOTES:<br /><br />Gus wrote this song in early 2015.  He and a friend shot some footage at our home in Long Beach, NY—where a couple of his other videos were shot. Gus liked shooting in the basement, and in the garage. He liked playing with atmosphere.  In this one, he was playing with light and shadow.  He was also very proud of his new glasses.  He needed prescription glasses, and this was the only pair he ever had with a prescription in them. <br /><br />/////<br /> <br />Directed by Mezzy<br />Animation by Bryson Michael<br />Shot by Will Silberfeld<br />Produced by Smokeasac &amp; IIVI<br /> <br />/////<br /> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://lilpeep.com">http://lilpeep.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/lilpeep">http://twitter.com/lilpeep</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/lilpeep">http://instagram.com/lilpeep</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://soundcloud.com/lil_peep">http://soundcloud.com/lil_peep</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/lilpeepmusic">http://facebook.com/lilpeepmusic</a>{% endraw %}
