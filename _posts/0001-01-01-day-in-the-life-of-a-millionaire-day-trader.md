{% raw %}Here is a glimpse into a typical day of my life as a trader! My routine as a Trader comprises of waking up at 9:00am EST, setting my coffee to brew at 9:05am EST and then heading to my desk to open my Trading platform to set up my charts. I then log into the Trading room and start scanning for stocks that are gapping up or down so I can build a watchlist of stocks I want to day trade. I then post my list in the Trading room by 9:15am EST. Afterwards, I take about 15 minutes to review my open portfolio positions and other swing trades I might be in. <br /><br />I day trade until about 11:00am EST and then I hop onto Live Stream in the chatroom where I review all my trades for the day. I also scan for some options trades and answer questions from the chatroom members while giving them feedback on their Trades. Typically, I am done by around 12:00pm EST. I usually spend the rest of my day in meetings or other daily activities. Other days, I might still be at my desk scanning and looking for swing trades. <br /><br />âœ…My REAL Social Accounts<br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/deltaninety/">https://www.instagram.com/deltaninety/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DeltaNinety">https://twitter.com/DeltaNinety</a><br />Book: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://preppingforsuccess.com/book">http://preppingforsuccess.com/book</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://livetraders.com/">https://livetraders.com/</a><br /><br />What Part 2 here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tH9op0fa1Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tH9op0fa1Y</a><br /><br />0:00 Waking Up<br />0:57 Having Coffee<br />1:45 Making a Watchlist<br />2:14 Taking my First Trade<br />2:58 Reviewing my Trade<br />4:06 Found a Swing Trade<br />4:35 Sending out Newsletter<br />5:30 Chatting to the Members<br />7:30 Driving to a Meeting<br />8:35 Checking out some Boats<br />10:34 Back Home<br /><br />#daytrading #trading #stockmarket<br /><br />Day in the Life of a Trader<br />Day in the Life of a Trader Video - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5uEcdQBKsI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5uEcdQBKsI</a>{% endraw %}
