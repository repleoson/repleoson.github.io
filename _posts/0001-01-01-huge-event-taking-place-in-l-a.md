We talk about many topics like biblical prophesy, political topics, breaking news &amp; giving honest truth that the media twist. We got to a point where watching the news was becoming unbearable to watch, misleading people down a wrong path, we hope to give a voice to those afraid to speak out... we are silenced by the media and the news and it shouldn’t be like that. #Prophecy #EndTimes #2021Events  <br /><br />Email - Santiagoluis226@gmail.com<br />THE OFFICIAL GRAND SUPREME NEWS WEBSITE<br />✅ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.grandsupremenews.net">https://www.grandsupremenews.net</a><br /><br />PODCAST<br />✅ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.grandsupremenews.net/podcast">https://www.grandsupremenews.net/podcast</a> (Coming Soon)<br /><br />PATREON <br />✅ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/grandsupremenews">https://www.patreon.com/grandsupremenews</a><br /><br />SPOTIFY CHRISTIAN PLAYLIST<br />✅ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/2JF4iLb">https://spoti.fi/2JF4iLb</a><br /><br />PRAYER WALL<br />✅<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2M1JRtq">https://bit.ly/2M1JRtq</a><br /><br />DISCORD<br />✅ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/s3sJmmW">https://discord.gg/s3sJmmW</a><br /><br />EARTHQUAKE INFORMATION<br />✅ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquak...">https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquak...</a><br /><br />CONTACTING US<br />▪Message Us On Facebook - m.me/grandsupremenews<br />▪Email - Santiagoluis226@gmail.com<br />▪PO Box (Letters &amp; Prayers) <br /><br />Luis Santiago<br />P.O.

If Jesus modeled it… we want to live it. If Jesus commanded it… we want to obey it. We believe everything Jesus practiced and preached is as relevant for us today as it was at the time of Christ’s earthly life and ministry. <br />▪Non-denominational-Having no authority or doctrines dictated by any outside board or affiliation.” We believe in order to stay as true as possible to the patterns of church life in the New Testament, we must avoid denominational labels and doctrines that identify us with one group exclusively. This does not mean, however, that anything goes!<br />▪Jesus Christ-Jesus is the only Son of God. We believe that His earthly life and ministry demonstrated and proved this: All people matter to God. We believe that if anyone wants to come to God, they must first invite Jesus Christ to be Savior and Lord of their life. <br />▪Worship-worship is fundamental to the abundant life of a growing Christian. We encourage all expressions of worship we read about in the Bible.<br />▪The Bible (KJV) Preferred-The only complete and infallible written Word of God. We also believe God still speaks to us today through His Holy Spirit.<br />▪What we believe about… You-EVERYONE seeking/not seeking Christ is welcome to hear the word of God.. NO ONE IS BEYOND SAVING! We love you as Christ loves the Church &amp; hope God will work Miracles in your life to find a Relationship with you.<br /><br />EQUIPMENT USED<br />CAMERA - LOGITECH 4K PRO WEBCAM<br />▪<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/y7fxrhz7">https://tinyurl.com/y7fxrhz7</a><br /><br />MICROPHONE - YETI BLUE USB MICROPHONE BLACKOUT<br />▪<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/y9cffqb3">https://tinyurl.com/y9cffqb3</a><br /><br />COMPUTER - MACBOOK PRO LAPTOP<br />▪<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/yckplczf">https://tinyurl.com/yckplczf</a>{% endraw %}
