{% raw %}When closing your real estate sale, the closing date is not usually set in stone.  There are hundreds of moving parts in the typical real estate transaction and it is not uncommon for closing dates to change from what was originally placed in the contract.  Be prepared to be flexible on closing date.{% endraw %}
