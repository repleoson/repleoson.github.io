{% raw %}Billy Strings - Help on the Way/Slipknot!/Franklin's Tower (Grateful Dead cover) - The Fillmore, Detroit, Michigan - 11/21/2021<br /><br />Paradise waits for a &quot;well behaved&quot; Detroit crowd, largely adorned in Grateful Dead t-shirts, who are rewarded late in the second set of the second show at this stunning venue with a long time crowd pleaser to close Billy String's ambitious 2021 tour.  The crossover of Deadheads into Strings fans happened long before the successful &quot;Billy and The Kids&quot; lineup this past year. Bob Weir was asked before the 2019 Dead &amp; Company NYE show how he defined a &quot;Deadhead.&quot;  He responded just exactly perfectly along the lines of, &quot;a Deadhead is someone who craves a sense of adventure, and we offer that to them musically.&quot;  Much like the Dead, Billy Strings unquestionably quenches an adventurous thirst by transforming his musical roots into a Bluegrass/Rock fusion dosed with Jazz like improvisational jams, shattering the traditional rigid barriers of the Bluegrass genre. He reminds me much of young Jerry Garcia in the sense that, despite his youth, Strings breathes a sense of soulfulness into every song that is beyond his years and he holds a rare talent that will foreseeably land him among the legends of guitar history.<br /><br />This amateur cellular telephone video is protected under Title 17 U.S.C.
