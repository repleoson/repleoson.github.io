{% raw %}Say hi to our super motivated special guest Frans, also known as „Alle Farben“ ♥︎ He visited me at home, to film a Song Workout to his hit „Alright“ /  Anzeige  <br /><br />First things first: he did AMAZING :D <br />He learned so quickly, didn’t moan and groan &amp; was totally down to do the (cringy) drama moves haha! I had backup plans in case he’s „not so fun“ but he went aaaall in! Loved it. Our biggest Ab Workout that day was laughing :D <br /><br />This video works perfectly:<br />- as a full body warm up<br />- as a short &amp; sweet workout <br />- to get your heart rate up in between other videos<br /><br />PS: We also filmed a secooooond one to a new single! Will be out next year :) <br /><br />__<br /><br />„Alright“ is also in my workout playlist.
