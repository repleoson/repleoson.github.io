{% raw %}You're an entrepreneur and want to start your US company. You found this online platform that handles everything for $500 or so. Should you go for it? <br />That's what we are going to look into today. <br /><br />Why should you do it? <br />When is the right time?<br />An overview of the process<br /> <br />Alright, most companies are incorporated as C-Corporations. The second, rather common alternative is LLCs or limited liability corporations.<br />An LLC is a type of company organized under an Operating Agreement, which is a contract between the owners specifying how it will be run and how the economic burdens and returns will be split.<br /><br />We'll focus on C-Corps, today. In our experience with investors and accelerators, most of them will want to invest on Delaware C-Corps: so if your plan is to raise venture capital, that's probably the way you want to go. <br />A C-corporation is an entity designed to act as an abstraction layer between the operators of the business and the owners of the business.  The power of a C-Corp is that it generally separates liability from the business owners. <br />Ownership is tracked by shares, with each share corresponding to a defined portion of control of the business and entitlement to the economic upside of it. <br />The state of Delaware has a highly developed body of law governing corporations.<br />So why doing it? <br />Clarity with Co-Founders.<br />While those agreements can be put in paper first, as your product and company increase in value you'll need to have them in full, legal writing, and a legal corporation is the best way to do it. <br />Allows Equity Ownership and Compensation<br />Not only for founder shares but for early team members. You'll want to define an option pool for them to compensate them for taking a risk with your company. <br />Intellectual Property<br />If you are developing code,  that code belongs to you unless you have a contract with the company. By creating a C-Corporation you can ensure that all code generated is owned by the company.<br />Personal Liability Protection<br />If the corporation is sued, the assets of its founders are more likely to be protected.<br /><br />You will probably not be able to raise money to your name. It needs to be put into a corporation.<br /><br />While incorporating normally costs around $500, you need to pay around $500-$800 per year in state fees. <br />Furthermore, you need to be compliant with accounting and tax filings.<br /><br />The process is rather straightforward and we laid it out in our platform FounderHub. We built that specifically to help founders navigate this process. <br />1. Filing takes about a day. <br />2. You'll want an EIN number.<br />3. You'll need to define a Board of Directors and company Bylaws.<br />4. You'll need to define share ownership and vesting. <br />5. Very important, if you are vesting stock, you'll need to file an 83B election form.<br />6. You'll want to sign a Restricted Covenants Agreement between the founders. <br />We have details on each one of these steps as well as document templates available on our free FounderHub platform. <br /><br />If you are from outside of the US, this last part is for you.<br />Do you need a US company vs a local company? It depends. <br />a- If your product is global, and you want to bill customers around the world, it is expected for those credit card charges to come from the US. <br />b- Charging credit cards as a US company is very easy. Stripe and Square are two companies that have perfected that model.<br />c- If you are looking for US investors, or even plan to raise from investors from multiple countries, they can probably all agree to invest on a Delaware C-Corp.<br />d- Startup mechanisms such as vesting, stock option pools, and convertible notes: not all countries have legislation or mechanism in place to handle these agreements, it's all quite standardized in the US. <br /><br />#startups #incorporate #smallbusiness<br />Slidebean:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://slidebean.com/">https://slidebean.com/</a><br /><br />Create a Pitch Deck: slidebean.com/pitch-deck?utm_source=youtube.com&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=video-content&amp;utm_term=incorporate<br /><br />FounderHub:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://founderhub.io/">https://founderhub.io/</a><br /><br />Demo Day: how to deliver a startup pitch deck<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/IO11PLB2UV8">https://youtu.be/IO11PLB2UV8</a><br /><br />Seed Funding for Startups<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/4RAs9Y5wwDo">https://youtu.be/4RAs9Y5wwDo</a><br /><br />Convertible Notes, Equity, and Startup Funding Explained<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/njx09wXb9o0">https://youtu.be/njx09wXb9o0</a><br /><br />If you found this useful, help us out by subscribing and sharing.<br /><br />â–º Subscribe to our Channel Here <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=slidebean">http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=slidebean</a><br />-- About Us: <br />Slidebean is a pitch deck creation tool with hundreds of templates available to use as a starting point.
