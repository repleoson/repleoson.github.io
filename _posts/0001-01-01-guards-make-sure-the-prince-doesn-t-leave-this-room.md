{% raw %}i love this dialogue...<br /><br />Monthy Python's Holly Grail - Swamp Castle<br /><br />Keenest guards ever!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />One day, lad, all this will be yours!<br /><br />PRINCE HERBERT:<br /><br />What, the curtains?<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />No. Not the curtains, lad. All that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys of this land! This'll be your kingdom, lad.<br /><br />HERBERT:<br /><br />But Mother--<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Father, lad. Father.<br /><br />HERBERT:<br /><br />B-- b-- but Father, I don't want any of that.<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Listen, lad. I built this kingdom up from nothing. When I started here, all there was was swamp. Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp. So, I built a second one. That sank into the swamp. So, I built a third one. That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp, but the fourth one... stayed up! And that's what you're gonna get, lad: the strongest castle in these islands.<br /><br />HERBERT:<br /><br />But I don't want any of that. I'd rather--<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Rather what?!<br /><br />HERBERT:<br /><br />I'd rather...<br /><br />[music]<br /><br />...just... sing!<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Stop that! Stop that! You're not going into a song while I'm here. Now listen, lad. In twenty minutes, you're getting married to a girl whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.<br /><br />HERBERT:<br /><br />B-- but I don't want land.<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Listen, Alice,--<br /><br />HERBERT:<br /><br />Herbert.<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />'Erbert. We live in a bloody swamp. We need all the land we can get.<br /><br />HERBERT:<br /><br />But-- but I don't like her.<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Don't like her?! What's wrong with her?! She's beautiful. She's rich. She's got huge... tracts o' land!<br /><br />HERBERT:<br /><br />I know, but I want the-- the girl that I marry to have...<br /><br />[music]<br /><br />...a certain,... special... something!<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Cut that out! Cut that out! Look, you're marrying Princess Lucky, so you'd better get used to the idea!<br /><br />[smack]<br /><br />Guards! Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />Not to leave the room even if you come and get him.<br /><br />GUARD #2:<br /><br />Hic!<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />No, no. Until I come and get him.<br /><br /><br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the room.<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />No, no. No. You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />And you'll come and get him.<br /><br />GUARD #2:<br /><br />Hic!<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Right.<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />We don't need to do anything apart from just stop him entering the room.<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />No, no. Leaving the room.<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />Leaving the room. Yes.<br /><br />[sniff]<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />All right?<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />Right.<br /><br />GUARD #2:<br /><br />Hic!<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Right.<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />Oh, if-- if-- if, uhh-- if-- if-- w-- ehh-- i-- if-- if we--<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Yes? What is it?<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />Oh, i-- if-- i-- oh--<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Look, it's quite simple.<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />Uh...<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />You just stay here and make sure 'e doesn't leave the room. All right?<br /><br />GUARD #2:<br /><br />Hic!<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Right.<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />Oh, I remember. Uhh, can he leave the room with us?<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />N-- no, no. No. You just keep him in here and make sure he--<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />Oh, yes. We'll keep him in here, obviously, but if he had to leave and we were with him--<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />No, no, no, no. Just keep him in here--<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />Until you or anyone else--<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />No, not anyone else. Just me.<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />Just you.<br /><br />GUARD #2:<br /><br />Hic!<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Get back.<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />Get back.<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />All right?<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />Right. We'll stay here until you get back.<br /><br />GUARD #2:<br /><br />Hic!<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />And, uh, make sure he doesn't leave.<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />What?<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Make sure 'e doesn't leave.<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />The Prince?<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Yes. Make sure 'e doesn't leave.<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />Oh, yes, of course.<br /><br />GUARD #2:<br /><br />Hic!<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />Ah. I thought you meant him. You know, it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard.<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Is that clear?<br /><br />GUARD #2:<br /><br />Hic!<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />Oh, quite clear. No problems.<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Right. Where are you going?<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />We're coming with you.<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />No, no. I want you to stay here and make sure 'e doesn't leave.<br /><br />GUARD #1:<br /><br />Oh, I see. Right.<br /><br />HERBERT:<br /><br />But Father!<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Shut your noise, you! And get that suit on!<br /><br />[music]<br /><br />And no singing!<br /><br />GUARD #2:<br /><br />Hic!<br /><br />FATHER:<br /><br />Oh, go and get a glass of water.<br /><br />[clank]{% endraw %}
