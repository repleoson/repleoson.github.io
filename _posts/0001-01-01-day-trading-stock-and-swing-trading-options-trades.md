{% raw %}Day trading options and swing trading stock picks were found using Option Stalker. Day trading options and swing trading stock picks were bullish given market conditions. Our market opinion drives our trading and once we have our directional bias we use Option Stalker to find these characteristics: heavy volume, relative strength, momentum, liquid options and technical breakouts. The more checkboxes we mark, the higher our probability of success. If the options are not liquid, we will day trade the stock. We do not want to miss a high probability day trading opportunity just because of poor option liquidity. Options day traders favor weekly in the money options that have a delta greater than .65. When we are swing trading options we favor selling out of the money bullish put spreads so that we can take advantage of accelerated time decay and we can distance ourselves from the action. <br /><br />Take the Option Stalker 2 week free trial. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.oneoption.com">http://www.oneoption.com</a><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/oneoption?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/oneoption?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Read my daily pre-open market comments on Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/1OptionsTrading">https://twitter.com/1OptionsTrading</a>{% endraw %}
