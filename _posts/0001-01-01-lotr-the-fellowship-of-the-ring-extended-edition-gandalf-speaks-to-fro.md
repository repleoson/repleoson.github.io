{% raw %}The extended edition version of when Gandalf talks to Frodo about Gollum, after Frodo sees him in the shadows of Moria. (HD Blu-ray)<br /><br />I love this scene and the final lines by Gandalf, which are used again at the end of FotR, are so wise and comforting.<br /><br />Frodo: &quot;I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.&quot;<br /><br />Gandalf: &quot;So do all who live to see such times but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.&quot;<br /><br />My main channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/XEgalmothOfGondolin">http://www.youtube.com/user/XEgalmothOfGondolin</a><br /><br />&quot;Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
