{% raw %}Since I have a large collection of regular notebooks, my attention has now turned to original pieces that could bring something new or different to my collection. <br /><br />I discovered this model and thought it could be great as a one piece transportable notebook. Mark's Inc was kind enough to send me one for a review (disclaimer: I have no specific connection with them) and so here it is. <br /><br />You can find additional information on their website : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.marks.jp/en/product/storage_it.html">http://www.marks.jp/en/product/storage_it.html</a><br /><br />And purchase it from Amazon.com : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/MARKSTYLE-TOKYO-STORAGE-Notebook-Orange/dp/B00IID10KK">https://www.amazon.com/MARKSTYLE-TOKYO-STORAGE-Notebook-Orange/dp/B00IID10KK</a>{% endraw %}
