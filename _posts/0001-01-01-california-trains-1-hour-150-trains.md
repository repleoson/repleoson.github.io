{% raw %}All aboard! Let's look at trains from all over the state of California - it's California Trains! You will see just about every different train in California - steam, diesel, passenger, and freight - it's all here! A wide variety of some of my best shots of trains running in California in all different climates: sunny beaches, shady redwood forests, dry deserts, and even snowy mountains. Trains and railroads featured include Amtrak, Coaster, BNSF, Union Pacific, Metrolink, Caltrain, ACE, Pacific Sun, Fillmore and Western, Skunk Train, California State Railroad Museum, Niles Canyon Railway, Orange Empire Railway Museum, and many more! <br /><br />This is by far the longest video I have ever released, so be sure to let me know if you like these longer videos. Thanks!<br /><br /><br />Intro music courtesy of The Mysterious Mr. Shoe.<br /><br />CoasterFan2105 is a channel dedicated to providing you with some of the best videos of trains and railroads on the web.
