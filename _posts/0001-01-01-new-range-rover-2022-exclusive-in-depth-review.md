{% raw %}Need help buying your next car? Click the following link and my team and I will help you choose your ideal car at a fair price - from Mat Watson! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/-Help-Me-carwow">http://bit.ly/-Help-Me-carwow</a><br />.............................................................<br /><br />This is the brand new Range Rover, and Mat’s got his hands on one for an all-new in-depth review! <br /><br />Now although it still clearly looks like a Range Rover, there are a number of exterior design updates which distinguish it from older models. For example, at the back, there are some all-new tail lights, while the rest of the car has a sleek &amp; modern look to it. <br /><br />Once you take a step inside, you’ll find an updated interior style along with an all-new infotainment system to use. And of course, as you’d expect, high-quality materials are used throughout the cabin. <br /><br />Once you move to the back seats, there are a number of bespoke options to choose from. For example, you could choose to go for a luxurious 4-seater model, and now, for the first time, you can get the Range Rover as a 7-seater! <br /><br />Prices start from £95,000, raising to approximately £150,000 for the top-of-the-range 4.4-litre V8 powered model! But is it worth it? And more importantly, has the design improved compared to the previous model? You’ll need to keep watching to find out!<br /><br />Chapters<br />00:00 Intro<br />01:07 Exterior Design<br />02:45 Interior<br />03:16 Back Seats<br />05:42 Interior &amp; Exterior Tech<br />07:40 Boot<br />08:26 Chassis<br />09:39 Engines<br />10:46 Off-roading<br />11:25 Price<br /><br />.............................................................<br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/carwow">http://www.instagram.com/carwow</a><br /><br />Tiktok - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow">https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow</a><br /><br />Facebook – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk">http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk</a><br /><br />Twitter – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk">http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk</a><br /><br />Sign Up to our Newsletter – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/carwow-Newsletter">http://bit.ly/carwow-Newsletter</a><br /><br />Awkward haggling is a thing of the past with carwow.
