{% raw %}David and David explain why you shouldn't sign up for a pay-as-you-go cell phone plan. <br /><br />Firstly, pay-as-you-go is a bit of a misleading phrase. What you're really doing is giving your carrier money upfront, and they're deducting from that total as you go.<br /><br />These plans are outdated and, a lot of the time, the amount you pay to the carrier is more than you'd pay if you signed up for a regular prepaid plan.<br /><br />If you're looking for an alternative, we highly recommend Verizon's 3 GB Prepaid Plan: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.upphone.com/cell-phone-plans/verizon/verizon-prepaid-plans-review-cost-price/">https://www.upphone.com/cell-phone-plans/verizon/verizon-prepaid-plans-review-cost-price/</a><br /><br />For awesome iPhone fixes and tips, check out our website, Payette Forward: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.payetteforward.com">https://www.payetteforward.com</a><br /><br />Compare every cell phone, every plan, and every carrier on UpPhone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.upphone.com">https://www.upphone.com</a><br /><br />Get Social With Payette Forward:<br />On Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/payetteforwardinc">https://www.facebook.com/payetteforwardinc</a><br />On Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/payetteforward">https://twitter.com/payetteforward</a>{% endraw %}
