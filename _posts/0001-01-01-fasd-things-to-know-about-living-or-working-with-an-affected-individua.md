{% raw %}Parents Helping Parents and the Inclusion Collaborative created this webinar for parents, families, and professionals who live and/or work with an individual who has a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) and a history of trauma.  It deals with the difficult behaviors associated with this brain-based disability and strategies to address them.  <br /><br />Learn from Nate Sheets, an international FASD behavior consultant and trainer. During the 75-minute presentation with extended Q/A, Nate explains how FASD and trauma have a lifelong impact on individuals and their families. <br /><br />FASD is a unique disability that differs from all others and can present the most emotionally difficult challenges for families.

The information is good for family members, friends/community members, and professionals who work with an individual who has FASD.<br /><br />About The Presenter:  <br />Nate Sheets <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cognitivesupports.com/">https://cognitivesupports.com/</a> goal is to equip supporters of people with FASD's.
