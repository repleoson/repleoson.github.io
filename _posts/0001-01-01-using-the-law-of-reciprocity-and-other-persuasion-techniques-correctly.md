It’s considered by many to be the most powerful law of human nature. Basically, it states that,<br /><br />“If you do something nice for me I’ll do something nice for you. I feel obligated to reciprocate.”<br /><br />For example, if we go out to lunch and I pick up the bill, you almost always offer to pay for it next time. Next time we go out to lunch, you insist on paying for the bill. There are different types of reciprocation which I will explain in the video.<br /><br />===================================================<br />ABOUT BRIAN TRACY<br /><br />Brian is recognized as the top sales training and personal success authority in the world today.
