{% raw %}This geometry video tutorial provides a basic introduction into lines, rays, line segments, points, and angles.  It also explains the difference between the union and intersection symbols and contains a few practice problems associated with it.  Lines extend infinitely in both directions.  Rays have a common endpoint and extend infinitely in one direction.  Line segments have a beginning and an end and possess a definite length.  Angles are composed of two rays that meet at a common endpoint or a vertex.  <br /><br />Geometry Playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8wdKOsUD-4&amp;index=3&amp;list=PL0o_zxa4K1BVkRxCZubMPcCJ5Q5QwZdEM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8wdKOsUD-4&amp;index=3&amp;list=PL0o_zxa4K1BVkRxCZubMPcCJ5Q5QwZdEM</a><br /><br />Access to Premium Videos:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor">https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor</a>{% endraw %}
