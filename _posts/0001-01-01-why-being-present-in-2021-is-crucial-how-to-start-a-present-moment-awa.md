{% raw %}Why Being Present in 2021 is CRUCIAL (&amp; How to Start A Present Moment Awareness Practice +Resources)<br /><br />Being present is a vital practice that I have tried to make a part of my life for a long time, however, I have felt the need to amplify my practice of being present and being here in this moment and now in this year in particular and during these current times on our planet.<br /><br />I feel like we're going through one of the greatest times on our planet and in our lives and with this level of evolution in consciousness the need for us to be present is at an all-time high. with all these constant changes we need to be able to stay grounded and although the outside exterior of our lives may be constantly changing we need to be able to flow with those changes and navigate in the best way possible and being present helps us do that.<br /><br />Being present has been crucial in my own journey during these times as I've had a lot of changes take place in the external reality of my life as I'm sure many of you have as well and being present has helped me navigate change and see my options more clearly and don't add my own stories of to what's going on and instead let it be as it is instead of adding my own interpretation of what it is and making it worse than it is, no, seeing it as it is (through being present) has helped me a lot in navigating these changes specially in 2021.<br /><br />In this video, I also share a practice of how you can begin to bring more present moment awareness into your life and into your days.<br /><br />I hope this helps you and encourages you to begin bringing present moment awareness and being present into your life.<br /><br />Resources:<br />FREE, Powerful, QIGONG Exercise That We've Made For You: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pjebadi.com/free-qigong-exercise/">https://www.pjebadi.com/free-qigong-exercise/</a><br />The Body as a Gateway Into the Present Moment (+ Guided Body Awareness Meditation): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/2wC_k_wIMiU">https://youtu.be/2wC_k_wIMiU</a><br />The Letting Go Technique By David Hawkins Explained (How To Handle Emotions): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/jGXsuPyZFq8">https://youtu.be/jGXsuPyZFq8</a><br />Success Through Stillness: Meditation Made Simple by Russell Simmons: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3FeHc8V">https://amzn.to/3FeHc8V</a><br />The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment by Eckhart Tolle: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3wnQcnR">https://amzn.to/3wnQcnR</a><br />Practicing the Power of Now: Essential Teachings, Meditations, and Exercises from the Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3vi45m6">https://amzn.to/3vi45m6</a><br /><br />Chapters:<br />Why Being Present is IMPORTANT: 00:00â€‹<br />The BENEFITS of Being Present: 2:45<br />A Present Moment Awareness Practice: 12:21<br />Some Resources to Help You in Being Present: 17:55<br />Why Being Present in 2021 is CRUCIAL: 22:45<br /><br />Why Being Present is CRUCIAL in 2021 (How to Start A Present Moment Awareness Practice + Some Resources to Help You in Being Present)<br /><br />Why Being Present is VITAL in 2021 (How to Start A MEDITATION Practice + Some Resources to Help You in Being Present)<br /><br />#PresentMoment{% endraw %}
