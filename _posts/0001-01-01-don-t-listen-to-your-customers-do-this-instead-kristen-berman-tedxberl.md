{% raw %}Visit our website www.tedxberlin.de for more information on Kristen Berman.  Kristen Berman studies how people actually act in the marketplace, as opposed to how they should or would perform if they were completely rational. <br /><br />Kristen co-founded Irrational Labs, a behavioral product design company, with Dan Ariely in 2013. Irrational Labs helps companies and nonprofits understand and leverage behavioral economics to increase the health, wealth and happiness of their users. She also co-founded Common Cents Lab, a Duke University initiative dedicated to improving the financial well-being for low to middle Americans. Common Cents has launched over 50 experiments with companies, touching tens of thousands of people. <br /><br />She was on the founding team for the behavioral economics group at Google, a group that touches over 26 teams across Google, and hosts ones of the top behavioral change conferences globally, StartupOnomics. She co-authored a series of workbooks called Hacking Human Nature for Good: A practical guide to changing behavior, with Dan Ariely. These workbooks are being used at companies like Google, Intuit, Neflix, Fidelity, Lending Club for business strategy and design work. <br /><br />Before designing, testing and scaling products that use behavioral economics, Kristen was a Sr. Product Manager at Intuit and camera startup, Lytro. She built product management and marketing systems for small businesses and consumers, for domestic and international markets, for mobile and web, working on front and back end systems. The core thread throughout this all is a deep passion for understanding why people behave the way they do and then building solutions that make their lives better. <br /><br />Kristen is an advisor for Loop Commerce, Code For America Accelerator and the Genr8tor Incubator and has spoken at Google, Facebook, Fidelity, Equifax, Stanford, Bay Area Computer Human Interaction seminar and more. <br /><br />Website: www.irrationallabs.org This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
