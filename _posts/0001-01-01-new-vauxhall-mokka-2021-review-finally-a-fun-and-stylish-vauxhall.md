{% raw %}Futuristic looks and a properly techy interior is the perfect antidote the ultra-deary previous-gen Mokka. But is the new crossover as fun to drive as it looks?<br /><br />It certainly faces some stiff competition, especially in the form of the Ford Puma which is not only great to drive but is super specious too.
