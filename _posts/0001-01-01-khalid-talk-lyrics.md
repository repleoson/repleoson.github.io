Can we just talk?<br />Talk about where we're goin'<br />Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts<br />Can't get what we want without knowin'<br />I've never felt like this before<br />I apologize if I'm movin' too far<br />Can we just talk? Can we just talk?<br />Figure out where we're goin'<br /><br />[Verse 1]<br />Yeah, started off right<br />I can see it in your eyes<br />I can tell that you're wantin' more<br />What's been on your mind?<br />There's no reason we should hide<br />Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before<br /><br />[Refrain]<br />Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it<br />And it's you I'm on<br />So stop thinkin' 'bout it<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Can we just talk? Can we just talk?<br />Talk about where we're goin'<br />Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts (Yeah)<br />Can't get what we want without knowin' (No)<br />I've never felt like this before<br />I apologize if I'm movin' too far<br />Can we just talk? Can we just talk?<br />Figure out where we're goin'<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />Oh, nah<br />Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room<br />I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked<br />Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late<br />I'll be there by five o'clock<br /><br />[Refrain]<br />Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it<br />And I'm what you want<br />So stop thinkin' 'bout it<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Can we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?<br />Talk about where we're goin'<br />Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts<br />Can't get what we want without knowin'<br />I've never felt like this before<br />I apologize if I'm movin' too far<br />Can we just talk? Can we just talk?<br />Figure out where we're goin'<br /><br />[Outro]<br />Figure out where we're goin'<br /><br />.........<br />📷 Wallpaper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unsplash.com/">https://unsplash.com/</a><br />.........<br />📧Contact: monstafluffmusicnetwork@gmail.com<br />.........<br /><br />#Khalid #Talk #Lyrics{% endraw %}
