{% raw %}Dave Rubin of The Rubin Report talks to Dr. Jordan Peterson, author of 12 Rules for Life and Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life, about what is actually informing COVID restrictions, the real choice that faces the clean energy COP26 crowd, and his response when he is asked about the existence of god. In this clip Jordan discusses the COP26 summit and the horrible position liberals and environmentalists have put themselves in by pushing for more expensive renewable energy while claiming to care for the poor. He explains why their more expensive energy plans will cause electricity prices to skyrocket, hurting those most vulnerable. He suggests we follow China’s lead and invest in nuclear power to create as much cheap energy as possible which can mitigate the effects of climate change without sacrificing the poor. He explains the problems of sustainable development and why you should dismiss anyone who advocates for Net Zero.<br /><br />Watch Dave Rubin's Interview with BJORN LOMBORG on the problems with the GREEN NEW DEAL:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yd9idPxmf6I&amp;list=PLEbhOtC9klbCe4nJu4Nsa_kLEmf7BMlN4&amp;index=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yd9idPxmf6I&amp;list=PLEbhOtC9klbCe4nJu4Nsa_kLEmf7BMlN4&amp;index=1</a><br /><br />Watch ALL of the JORDAN PETERSON Rubin Report interviews and some from other channels here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmNbAinZkX8&amp;list=PLEbhOtC9klbCWBRXDh8p9P3nCLAR0RQqE&amp;index=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmNbAinZkX8&amp;list=PLEbhOtC9klbCWBRXDh8p9P3nCLAR0RQqE&amp;index=1</a><br /><br />Is the state of US news driving you crazy?
