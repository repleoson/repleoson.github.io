{% raw %}Grab a cup of tea and settle in, let's play with some random DOTS - I have five bags of Extra Dots Series 5 with cute kawaii printed round tiles and the box of Lots of Dots. Now I have too many options and a crippling creative block. But I just had a go at doodling with the DOTS and it was very cathartic - lovely for some restful mindfulness.<br /><br />Hi! If you've just dropped by, I'm Ellie! Stick around and I'll build for you while I review new sets. I tend to geek out about new pieces, interesting building techniques, giggle too much and just generally ramble. I'm easily distracted so I get stuff wrong which I fix up, mostly, but in the end there is always an awesome model ready for play and display. Huzzah for Lego, the building and creating tool for anybody, no matter what age you are!<br /><br />And don't forget that you can also get a cool ellieV toys t-shirt and other stuff from here! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/elliev-toys-merch">https://teespring.com/stores/elliev-toys-merch</a><br /><br />Don't forget to subscribe! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/mPFBb1">https://goo.gl/mPFBb1</a><br /><br />Lots more ellieV toys videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/CXhf59">https://goo.gl/CXhf59</a><br />Sylvanian Families / Calico Critters videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1LpJvDr">http://bit.ly/1LpJvDr</a><br />Lego Friends videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/xbV84E">https://goo.gl/xbV84E</a><br /><br />Please subscribe and like if you enjoy - I appreciate every single one of your views!<br /><br />Music - Steppin out (audioblocks){% endraw %}
