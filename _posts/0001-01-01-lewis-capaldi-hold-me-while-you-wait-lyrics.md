(Hold me while you wait)<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />Tell me more, tell me something I don't know<br />Could we come close to having it all?<br />If you're gonna waste my time<br />Let's waste it right<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />And hold me while you wait<br />I wish that I was good enough (Hold me while you wait)<br />If only I could wake you up (Hold me while you wait)<br />My love, my love, my love, my love<br />Won't you stay a while? (Hold me while you wait)<br />I wish you cared a little more (Hold me while you wait)<br />I wish you'd told me this before (Hold me while you wait)<br />My love, my love, my love, my love<br />Won't you stay a while? (Hold me while you wait)<br /><br />[Bridge]<br />This is you, this is me, this is all we need<br />Is it true? My faith is shaken, but I still believe<br />This is you, this is me, this is all we need<br />So won't you stay a while?<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />And hold me while you wait<br />I wish that I was good enough (Hold me while you wait)<br />If only I could wake you up (Hold me while you wait)<br />My love, my love, my love, my love<br />Won't you stay a while? (Hold me while you wait)<br />I wish you cared a little more (Hold me while you wait)<br />I wish you'd told me this before (Hold me while you wait)<br />My love, my love, my love, my love<br />Won't you stay a while? (Hold me while you wait)<br /><br />[Outro]<br />Stay a while (Hold me while you wait)<br />Stay a while (Hold me while you wait)<br />My love, my love, my love<br />Won't you stay a while?<br /><br />If you wanna help support the channel and earn some free Crypto join CryptoTab with our Affiliate link! :) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cryptotabbrowser.com/15042256">https://cryptotabbrowser.com/15042256</a>{% endraw %}
