No problem, but curfew at eight!”<br /><br />[Pre Chorus]<br />It doesn’t matter what I do<br />Could have the song of the year<br />There’s one thing I always deal with<br />It’s become crystal clear<br />I wanna be a famous rapper but my mom doesn’t care<br />She’ll always treat me like her baby so my life is unfair<br />Check it out man<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />That’s why my life is unfair<br />I wanna be a famous rapper but my mom doesn’t care<br />It doesn’t matter what I do, could have the song of the year<br />She’ll always treat me like her baby so my life is unfair<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />You know what else?  man, I just got some red bottoms! (fuego!)<br />And my momma made me mow the lawn the same day that I got ‘em<br />How am I supposed to hit the gram and be cool<br />When I got this big green grass stain on my shoe ma<br />Then I got a new watch, you know the kind<br />It don’t tick like yours, it just slide<br />Left the jewelry store, made it home and dinner was delicious<br />Put my plate in the sink and mama told me to do the dishes<br />Now I’m standing at the sink tryna think<br />Wow… if I lose a diamond I’mma freak… out<br />Listening to music as a I scrub a dub dub<br />Feeling like a idiot from wearing yellow rubber gloves<br />And I finally get off all the grease <br />I got my phone blowing up from a girl that’s a dime piece <br />I said, “Mom, we’re just friends… I won’t kiss her”<br />She said, “I don’t if you go but you’re taking your baby sister”<br /><br />[Pre Chorus]<br />It doesn’t matter what I do<br />Could have the song of the year<br />There’s one thing I always deal with<br />It’s become crystal clear<br />I wanna be a famous rapper but my mom doesn’t care<br />She’ll always treat me like her baby so my life is unfair<br />Check it out man<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />That’s why my life is unfair<br />I wanna be a famous rapper but my mom doesn’t care<br />It doesn’t matter what I do, could have the song of the year<br />She’ll always treat me like her baby so my life is unfair{% endraw %}
