{% raw %}Release Date: January 28, 2013<br />Catalog #: SK 195<br />Label: Street King<br /><br />Tracklisting<br />1. Have A Good Time (Monkey Safari Remix)<br />2. My Urban Soul (Walker &amp; Royce Remix)<br />3. My Urban Soul (Walker &amp; Royce Dubstrumental)<br /><br />House producer / lyrical ace / DJ Roland Clark is here once more with a couple of tunes mixed like never before. One of his most renowned songs &quot;My Urban Soul&quot; gets a truly dope-ass funky deep re-rub by Brooklyn producers Walker &amp; Royce. Best known for their work on Nervous, Glasgow Underground, Crosstown Rebels and others, they took this previous #1 Billboard Club hit and ran it through the underground ringer. So good! A bonus cut on this double release is the more recent &quot;Have A Good Time,&quot; which will prep any room ready to rock. German deep house production team Monkey Safari is on remix duty offering more of that deep funky goodness. House a la mode all the way.  <br /><br />Available at Beatport{% endraw %}
