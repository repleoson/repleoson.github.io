{% raw %}The world is healthier and wealthier today than ever before. As the world becomes more connected and technologically advanced, some countries have made drastic improvements in life expectancy and economic growth. Many have implemented economic policies that encourage trade and others also receive developmental assistance from larger countries that see strategic value in providing aid. But other countries, especially those that have experienced political instability, natural disasters, and long-term domestic conflict, have seen less improvement. Development is a hard concept to define and its trends depend on many factors, that is why the United Nations launched its list of Sustainable Development Goals, a new environmentally friendly and inclusive framework for countries to develop.
