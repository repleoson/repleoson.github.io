{% raw %}I wanted to show how EXTILE can be used to eliminate any potential tiling issues on wall surfaces at next to no cost. Extile which eliminates repetitiveness on different types of textures can be used in a variety of situations from small scenes such as this one to large exterior scenes that would greatly benefit from the usage of just one texture to cover large surfaces. By simply adjusting  some of the master material parameters you can see how easy it is to get rid or any repetitiveness. The material can be found on the Unreal marketplace: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/non-repetitive-tiling-material">https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/non-repetitive-tiling-material</a>{% endraw %}
