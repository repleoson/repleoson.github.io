{% raw %}We all suffer from a gap between planning and doing: we make plans that we fail to carry out. This gap does not prove that we fail to do the right things - maybe we just fail to make the right plans. Ironically, the first step towards closing the gap is to realize that we cannot escape from it.<br /><br /><br /><br />Kirsten Rohde, Professor of Behavioral Economics at Erasmus University Rotterdam, is interested in helping people take responsibility for their own futures. Many of us suffer from a gap between planning and doing. This gap is the result of an ongoing struggle between our different selves. The talk shows that both our current and our future selves have a role when closing this gap. The current self needs to make realistic plans and the future self has to carry out these plans.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
