{% raw %}That thing almost took you out, but it was necessary for what God wants to manifest in your life. The hardship didn't happen because you were forgotten; it happened because you have a future. When God has a predestined plan for your life, He will preserve your way there. Yes, the path will come with painful twists and turns, but it is necessary to fulfill your destiny. Disaster disciplines faith, and disappointment points us back to the only place where peace is found: God's will. So even when it doesn't look like it, remember, God has your back.<br /><br />Sermon Title: It Was Necessary<br />Scripture: Romans 8:28 (ESV)<br />Speaker: Bishop Glen Staples<br />Date: Oct. 24th, 2021<br /><br />Subscribe to the official T.D.
