{% raw %}Frank Galvin is a down-on-his-luck lawyer reduced to drinking and ambulance chasing.  Former associate Mickey Morrissey reminds him of his obligations in a medical malpractice suit that he himself served to Galvin on a silver platter: all parties were willing to settle out of court.  Blundering his way through the preliminaries, Galvin suddenly realizes that perhaps, after all, the case should go to court to punish the guilty, to get a decent settlement for his clients and to restore his standing as a lawyer.{% endraw %}
