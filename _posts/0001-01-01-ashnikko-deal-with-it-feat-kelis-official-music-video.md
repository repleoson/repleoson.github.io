don’t need a man, I need a puppy <br />Allergic to you, every time you touch me  <br />Emotional maturity for dummies <br />I don’t have the time to pretend you’re funny  <br />I’m back and I’m better <br />I put the teddy bear you gave me in a blender <br />I drew a dick on all your sweatshirts <br />  <br />(I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW) <br />  <br />Deal with it, boy you got to <br />I don’t want you, do what you want <br />But just deal with it, cos I’m so over you <br />Deal with it, boy you got to <br />I don’t want you, do what you want <br />But just deal with it, cos I’m so over you <br />  <br />Ahhhh ooooh ooooh <br />(I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW) <br />Ahhhh ooooh ooooh <br />(I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW) <br />  <br />I don’t need a man, I need a rabbit <br />I need a new toy just to cleanse my palette <br />Big bad bitch, I’m the baddest <br />We both know it wasn’t love, it was just a big bad habit  <br />Stringing you along like a puppet <br />I can see the desperation, got you right where I want ya <br />Beg for it, plead, you can suck it <br />  <br />(I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW) <br />  <br />Deal with it, boy you got to <br />I don’t want you, do what you want <br />But just deal with it, cos I’m so over you <br />Deal with it, boy you got to <br />I don’t want you, do what you want <br />But just deal with it, cos I’m so over you <br />  <br />(AHHHHHHH) <br />Ahhhh ooooh ooooh <br />(I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW) <br />Ahhhh ooooh ooooh <br />(I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW) <br />  <br />Find me in the ball gown <br />With a champagne glass <br />With a man on my arm <br />I don’t care what his name is <br />I’ve really levelled up now <br />I got jets on my back  <br />Everything I do outrageous  <br />You text me that you miss me <br />I say who the fuck is this, I deleted your number <br />Oops, oh gee that’s a bummer <br />  <br />(I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW) <br />  <br />Deal with it, boy you got to <br />I don’t want you, do what you want <br />But just deal with it, cos I’m so over you <br />Deal with it, boy you got to <br />I don’t want you, do what you want <br />But just deal with it, cos I’m so over you <br />  <br />(AHHHHHHH) <br />Ahhhh ooooh ooooh <br />(I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW) <br />Ahhhh ooooh ooooh <br />(I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW) <br />Ahhhh ooooh ooooh <br /> (I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT
