{% raw %}Life is difficult to define, but there are characteristics of life that can be explored! Join the Amoeba Sisters as they explore several characteristics of life. Click &quot;show more&quot; to expand video details to see table of contents &amp; additional information. ðŸ‘‡<br /><br />We chose not to give a numerical value for how many characteristics of life there are, because we do not want to imply that what we are listing must be a specific order, or that it cannot be expanded upon or include exceptions. Additionally, characteristics can also certainly be titled differently.  Our goal is to promote thought and discussion about what it means for an organism to be alive as well as provide characteristics of life that can be explored when trying to study living things.<br /><br />CHARACTERISTICS OF LIFE MENTIONED IN THIS VIDEO:<br />Intro 00:00<br />Organization (all life is composed of 1 or more cells) 2:20<br />Homeostasis 2:54<br />Metabolism (including need to obtain+use energy) 3:35<br />Reproduction 4:22<br />Growth and Development 4:46<br />Response to Stimuli 5:10<br />Evolution (occurs in populations, can lead to adaptation) 5:58<br /><br />While living organisms tend to have ALL of the above characteristics, there are exceptions (such as the 'zonkey' mentioned in video at 6:55).<br /><br />*Quote Citation:<br />Mullen, Leslie.
