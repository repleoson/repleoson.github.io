{% raw %}From the album &quot;EPHEMERAL&quot;<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mrkittyngp.bandcamp.com/album/ephemeral">https://mrkittyngp.bandcamp.com/album/ephemeral</a><br /><br />Lyrics:<br />It was on a summer night<br />At last I knew the time was right<br />In the dark I finally met you<br /><br />Through the lights and heavy smoke<br />The lust between us tends to show<br />I’ll leave the crowd to get you closer<br /><br />The view is not the same without you<br />It’s not the same without you<br />It’s not the same without you<br />(x2)<br /><br />In a bath of lavender<br />You told me words I hadn’t heard<br />The music played and nothing hurt me<br /><br />On my chest I let you cry<br />I couldn’t find the reason why<br />This moment seemed to last forever<br /><br />The view is not the same without you<br />It’s not the same without you<br />It’s not the same without you<br />(x2)<br /><br />(Chorus x2){% endraw %}
