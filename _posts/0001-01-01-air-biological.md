The album was possibly named after the song &quot;Le Talkie Walkie&quot; by Serge Gainsbourg, a known influence of the duo. The track &quot;Alone in Kyoto&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the 2003 film Lost in Translation. This album has been released with the Copy Control protection system in some regions. &quot;Talkie-walkie&quot; is French for walkie-talkie.<br /><br />The music review online magazine Pitchfork placed Talkie Walkie at number 191 on their list of top 200 albums of the 2000s.{% endraw %}
