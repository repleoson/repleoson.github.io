{% raw %}This song is a protest anthem against bigoted, autocratic leaders who champion ignorance, perpetuate privilege and peddle hatred.<br /><br />It was written by Dusty Horwitt, Jonathan Engel and David Doobinin. It was produced with the help of Paul Friedman, Executive Director of Safer Country, an organization that works to prevent gun violence.<br /><br />The song calls on concerned, patriotic citizens to resist the attacks on long-cherished democratic values and institutions, and enlist in the fight to re-establish truth, fairness and diversity as hallmarks of civil debate.<br /><br />We would love musicians to perform this song at public gatherings and political events. Organizers of such events can also play this demo track, as a video with synched images. <br /><br />We ask only that you post your request as a comment on this site, providing your email address.
