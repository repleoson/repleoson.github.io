{% raw %}On Monday, the world received the shocking news of the death of retired General Colin Powell, who died at the age of 84 from complication of COVID-19.<br />Powell was the first African-American U.S. Secretary of State, whose leadership in three Republican administrations helped shape American defence and foreign policies in the last years of the 20th and the early years of the 21st centuries. <br />Powell was a distinguished and trailblazing professional soldier whose career took him from combat duty in Vietnam to becoming the first Black National Security Adviser during the end of Ronald Reagan's presidency and the youngest and first African-American Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President George H.W. Bush. <br /><br />Jamie E.
