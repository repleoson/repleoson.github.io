{% raw %}Many people do not know the difference between the Public and Private Sectors of Society. This is why oxymoronic terms like &quot;State Capitalism&quot; exist. Well, starting in Ancient Greece and Rome and moving forwards in time, we will show what the Public Sector and Private Sectors of the economy are, how they're defined, and explain what both Capitalism and Socialism are and why they are that as well. These are the actual historic definitions and meanings backed up by the sources listed in the pinned comment, at the beginning of the video, and references will be included at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />The script for this history video was 12,523 words. And yes, this is a history video. I am neither National Socialist, Fascist, Marxist Socialist or anything else like that. And as you can tell if you watch this video in full, I am absolutely NOT promoting any of these evil ideologies in the slightest.<br /><br />For a full list of all my sources, check out this link <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/114GiK85MPs0v4GKm0izPj3DL2CrlJUdAantx5GQUKn8/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/114GiK85MPs0v4GKm0izPj3DL2CrlJUdAantx5GQUKn8/edit?usp=sharing</a><br /><br />John Hargreaves's original question - &quot;In the creation of the National Socialist state by Hitler, did he not effectively privatize the whole state as his and his board of directors sole control?&quot;<br /><br />Want to ask a question?

I also want to dispel the myths and distortions that ruin our perception of the past by asking a simple question - “But is this really the case?”. I have a 2:1 Degree in History and a passion for early 20th Century conflicts (mainly WW2). I’m therefore approaching this like I would an academic essay. Lots of sources, quotes, references and so on. Only the truth will do.<br /><br />This video is discussing events or concepts that are academic, educational and historical in nature. This video is for informational purposes and was created so we may better understand the past and learn from the mistakes others have made. #history{% endraw %}
