{% raw %}Imagine you receive a bent I-Beam bar as imported geometry and need to determine its length before the bending was performed.<br /><br />This video is a possible solution to this challenge:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://forum.solidworks.com/message/740272">https://forum.solidworks.com/message/740272</a><br /><br />After the video was posted, Tom Helsley pointed out that the exact length can be obtain using a composite curve, instead of a fit spline. Thank you, Tom!<br /><br />For more case studies of bending and unbending &quot;stuff&quot; using SOLIDWORKS, watch these videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI35xrqqQVUv1X43B1fq4IZm0JT1AJ3Zu">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI35xrqqQVUv1X43B1fq4IZm0JT1AJ3Zu</a>{% endraw %}
