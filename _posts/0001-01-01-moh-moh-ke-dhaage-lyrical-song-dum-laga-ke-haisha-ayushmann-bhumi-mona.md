Prem (Ayushmann Khurrana) is a shy music buff who runs a tape recording shop in Haridwar. Sandhya (Bhumi Pednekar) likes to dance to the band tunes at her own wedding. He has nightmares about drawing a blank at his English exam. She is about to carve a niche for herself as a teacher.<br /><br />But now, they are married and they are supposed to spend a lifetime together - and he is still trying to find balance on their scooter ride together. From overcoming his fear of the English language to dealing with an overbearing father, he discovers that his oversized wife, who he thought was a spanner in his spool, will actually lead him to something quite cool.<br /><br />#YRFnewreleases #DumLagaKeHaisha #YRF #YRF50 #Yashraj #YashrajFilms #YRFmovies #YRFmusic #YashChopra #AdityaChopra #AyushmannKhurrana #BhumiPednekar #SharatKatariya #ManeeshSharma #AnuMalik #VarunGrover #MonaliThakur #MohMohKeDhaage #Bollywood <br /><br />Â© Yash Raj Films Pvt.
