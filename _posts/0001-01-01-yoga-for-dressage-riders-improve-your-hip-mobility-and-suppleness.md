{% raw %}This yoga routine for dressage riders is all about improving your hip mobility and flexibility to help with your overall suppleness in the saddle.  We train our horses to work on balance and symmetry, so it's important we do the same for ourselves. <br /><br />We flow through a series to movements to help lengthen and open our spine while at the same time improving energy and focus. <br /><br />This routine is a wee taste of our 12 Week Online Dressage Rider Training Program, which includes core, yoga and rider strength workouts to help you take your riding to a new level. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dressageridertraining.com/register/">https://dressageridertraining.com/register/</a><br /><br />Make sure you download our FREE guide here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dressageridertraining.com/guide/">https://dressageridertraining.com/guide/</a><br /><br />Enjoy this routine and enjoy your riding even more.{% endraw %}
