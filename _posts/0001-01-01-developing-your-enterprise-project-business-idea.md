{% raw %}The Enterprise Project is a central focus of the Postgraduate Diploma in Entrepreneurship offered by Cambridge Judge Business School. It can be an idea for a completely new business venture or a plan for growing an existing one. It can be an 'intrapreneurial project' or involve taking the helm of a family business. Equally, the project can be a social enterprise or educational initiative, either operating independently or as part of a larger organisation, company or university. It is important that students are passionate about the idea and have ambitions to take it forward.<br /><br />In this session, Dr Effie Pitsa, Programme Tutor, talks to Boni Sones OBE about how students develop their Enterprise Project and how the programme provides a framework for taking ideas from design to implementation. She also provides some advice on what prospective students should include about the Enterprise Project in their applications.<br /><br />Visit our website at www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/pgde to find out more about the structure and content of the programme, as well as the application process. You'll also be able to access a few stories about our alumni. If you have any questions, please contact the team at pgdiploma@jbs.cam.ac.uk. <br /><br />The next programme starts in September 2016. Applications are open until 30 April.{% endraw %}
