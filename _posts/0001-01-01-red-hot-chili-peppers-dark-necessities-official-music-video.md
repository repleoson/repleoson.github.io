Yeah<br /><br />You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind<br />Dark necessities are part of my design and<br />Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky<br />Dark necessities are part of my design<br /><br />Stumble down to the parking lot, you got<br />No time for the afterthought, they're like<br />Ice Cream for an Astronaut,well, that's me looking for we<br />Turn the corner and find the world at your command<br />Playin' the hand, yeah<br /><br />You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind<br />Dark necessities are part of my design<br />Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky<br />Dark necessities are part of my design<br /><br />Do you want this love of mine? Darkness helps us all to shine<br />Do you want it, do you want it now?<br />Do you want it all the time? But darkness helps us all to shine<br />Do you want it, do you want it now?<br /><br />Ah, pick you up like a paperback with the<br />Track record of a maniac so I<br />Move it in and we unpack, it's the same as yesterday<br />Any way we roll, everything must go away<br />Oh, what do you say? Yeah<br /><br />You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind<br />Dark necessities are part of my design<br />Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky and<br />Dark necessities are part of my design<br /><br />Ah-ah-ah<br />Ah-ah<br />Ah-ah-ah<br />Ah-ah<br />Ah-ah-ah<br />Ah-ah<br />Ah-ah-ah<br />Ah-ah<br /><br />#OfficialMusicVideo #RedHotChiliPeppers #DarkNecessities #WeAreWarnerRecords{% endraw %}
