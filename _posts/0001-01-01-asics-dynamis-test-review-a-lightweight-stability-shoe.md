Check out: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://runrepeat.com/asics-dynamis">https://runrepeat.com/asics-dynamis</a><br /><br />The Asics Dynamis is a great pair of lightweight support shoes that feature the BOA lacing system and a comfortable, cushioned feel without limiting agility. This is my first experience with the BOA lacing system, and I’ve been impressed so far.<br /><br />They deliver such micro-adjustments to the tightness, leaving you feeling secure in the knowledge that whatever tightness you’ve set, will secure your entire race and triathlons. They also cut down your transition time without sacrificing the feel you’re used to in training.<br /><br />BOA lacing system is a revelation. Unlike some elastic laces, it keeps your shoes tight which gives you great security over your runs without the concern of having to re-lace in mid-run.<br /><br />It can also make such small adjustments to the tightness. Meaning, you really can create a fit that’s perfect for your feet.<br /><br />For a support shoe, these are lightweight coming in at around 270 grams. This means they are pretty comfortable for pushing a faster pace.<br /><br />Even at this lighter weight, they still feature enough cushioning to feel comfortable over mid distances. I haven’t tried them over a half marathon yet, but they are great up to that distance.<br /><br />One of the greatest features of Asics Dynamis is the outsole. Aside from being durable, they are also created in a way that &quot;moving quickly&quot; in different directions is a breeze. These give the confidence to stop suddenly or dodge a branch on a trail.<br /><br />Size-wise, these are perfect! They come up bang on what I would expect and have experienced from other Asics shoes.<br /><br />If the shoes don’t feel tight enough after initially doing them up, try moving around a bit, wiggle your foot or jump around a few times.<br /><br />In summary, if you’re looking for a pair of lightweight running shoes that requires some support, these will treat you well. The Asics Dynamis is perfect, especially for fast shorter races and for triathlons.<br /><br />- Elliot Kortenray<br />RunRepeat Expert{% endraw %}
