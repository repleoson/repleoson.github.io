{% raw %}You have heard spiritual teachers talk again and again about allowing.  The state of allowing is perhaps the highest spiritual state to exist in.  But what does it mean to be allowing?  To be in a state of &quot;allowing&quot;, means to deliberately choose thoughts, words and actions that allow your desires to manifest in your reality.   In order for you to allow your desires to manifest, your thoughts, words and actions must line up with your desires.<br /><br />Most of us have the same picture in our minds when we think of allowing.  For most of us, the picture we have is a person who is blissed out and meditating in a state of complete, passive surrender to the universe.  We picture in our minds, a state of inactivity.  We imagine that allowing means letting the universe live out our lives for us.  We treat our lives as if we were chess pieces here to be played by the universe according to a pre determined game and we call it &quot;destiny&quot; or &quot;purpose&quot;.  But this picture of allowing is a misunderstanding.  The state of allowing is not a state of inaction; it is not a state of spiritual laziness and surrender.  It is a state of deliberate focus and inspired action.<br /><br />The most allowing state to be in is not the state of surrender.  The most allowing state to be in is the state of positive focus.  And the second most allowing state to be in is the state of taking inspired action.<br /><br />Subscribe to Receive a New Video Every Saturday: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SubTealSwan">http://bit.ly/SubTealSwan</a><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />If you are in a crisis or if you or any other person may be feeling suicidal or in danger the following resources can provide you with immediate help: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thecompletionprocess.com/get-help-now/">https://thecompletionprocess.com/get-help-now/</a> <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Teal Swan is a revolutionary for personal transformation and is one of The Most Spiritually Influential Living People in the world.
