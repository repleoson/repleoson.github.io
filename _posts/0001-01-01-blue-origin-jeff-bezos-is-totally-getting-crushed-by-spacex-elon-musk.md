We go back to the most recent war, Bezos' Blue Origin and Elon Musk's SpaceX, a battle that attracts paper headlines and news stories around the world. The battle between these two billionaires was turned up more than a decade ago. However, what is interesting here is that whenever the two men face-off, the winner is always on Elon Musk's side. He destroyed Jeff Bezos on every front, losing from contracts and ideas to develop rockets on the ground up to the race to the moon. <br />First of all, what was the previous relationship of the two billionaires like?<br />Legend has it there was a time when Musk and Bezos were friendly competitors in space, uh... space. The pair were photographed having a meal together back in 2004. They just sat down, and they talked shop. They talked about rockets: &quot;Well, how are you gonna do this? How are you gonna do that?&quot; &quot;Well, this is how we're doing it”. &quot;Here's how I wanna do it.&quot; At that time, both SpaceX and Blue Origin were relatively young companies. Neither had launched anything into space. And in fact, neither company even had a functioning rocket yet.<br />But fast-forward many years, SpaceX made its first successful test launch of a Falcon 1 in 2008, while Blue Origin conducted a few low-altitude flights of small test vehicles during the intervening four years.<br />When it comes to the scope of the earth, how did Musk beat Jeff Bezos?<br />The duo largely stayed out of each other's way for nearly a decade, but by 2013, it was clear the relationship had soured. At the time, NASA was looking to lease the historic launch pad 39A that sent the Apollo astronauts to the moon. Both companies put in proposals.  <br />Bezos even went as far as filing a complaint with the government to prevent SpaceX from getting that launchpad. And Elon Musk gets really mad about this, and he says, &quot;That's a phony blocking tactic”.  Musk even threw some public shade at Bezos in response to Blue Origin's protest, kicking off a war of words and legal maneuvers that continues today.<br />Blue Origin &amp; Jeff Bezos is totally getting Crushed by SpaceX &amp; Elon Musk.{% endraw %}
