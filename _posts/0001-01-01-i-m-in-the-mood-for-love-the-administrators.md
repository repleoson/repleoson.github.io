{% raw %}Taken from the album&quot;AND THEN THERE WERE TWO &quot;(THE ADMINISTRATORS GREATEST HITS)<br /><br />Who the **** are &quot;THE ADMINISTRATORS) <br /><br />You may well ask.Surprisingly enough &quot;The Administrators&quot; were one of the Uk's most successful Reggae Acts in the 80s and early 90s<br /><br />Racking up a string of consecutive no1 hits and received numerous awards including &quot;Best Reggae Band&quot; But with all<br /><br />these acolades, the band never managed to record an album,and for some even more obscure reason,fans of good music<br /><br />outside the Uk were denied the opportunity to discover what we believe were one of the Uks finest exports................<br /><br />Until now. POTENTIAL RECORDS and GROOVE AND A QUARTER RECORDS have combined to put together the definative<br /><br />Administrators album  entitled&quot;AND THEN THERE WERE TWO&quot;(THE ADMINISTRATORS<br /><br />GREATEST HITS) Which features all &quot;The Administrators &quot; hits,previously unreleased tracks plus new compositions <br /><br />from the new streamlined duo (hence the title) As well as two videos included on the album.We expect strong demand for this product.&quot;THE  ADMINISTRATORS&quot; will be playing a few special &quot;one -of gigs&quot; keep posted here or for up to the minute news /competitons/promos and giveawaways log on to POTENTIALRECORDS.COM{% endraw %}
