{% raw %}-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-<br /><br />What is StumbleUpon?<br /><br />StumbleUpon is a social media bookmarking site.  They have about 30 million users which sounds like a lot but pales in comparison to other sites.  I recently saw that the Facebook app has been downloaded more than 1 billion times.  StumbleUpon allows users to “like&quot; websites and add them to their profile. These websites are then shared with friends through their profile and by using the “stumble&quot; button. The stumble button basically sends a user to a random website based on your chosen interests. StumbleUpon asks their users to define the categories that interest them, everything from action movies to zoology.<br /><br />I think StumbleUpon is a pretty cool idea. The web is full of millions and millions and millions of websites. With so many websites out there, there's no way to ever really scratch the surface on your own.  StumbleUpon is a great way to be exposed to sites and content that you probably wouldn’t have been exposed to, all based on your interests you want to see and read about.<br /><br />You will start by creating an account or sign in using your Facebook account.  Users or “Stumblers” rate a site by giving it a “thumbs up” or “thumbs down.”  You can share your stumbles on other social media sites and leave comments about that Stumble.  StumbleUpon will create your Stumble DNA based on all of these choices.  Under settings you can add filters such as age appropriate content only.<br /><br />FOR BUSINESS:<br />StumbleUpon is category and interest based.  So if your business fits into one of these categories, your site can get a lot of new visitors that are more likely to be interested in your business.  But you need to be actively involved.  StumbleUpon will tag you as a spammer and kick you off if you are only promoting your business.  They do offer a pay-per-click service through their StumbleUpon Ads program.  Your content is the ad.  If you want to use StumbleUpon for promotional purposes, then you will need to sign up and it comes at a price which varies based on your needs. <br /><br />Even if these advertising services aren’t for you, StumbleUpon can help you create content on your other social media sites.  I’ve read that your social sites should contain 80% content and 20% product.  Not every pin on Pinterest or every tweet can be about your products.  Through StumbleUpon you can find interesting articles or infographics that are unique. The most important thing to remember when using social media for your business is to remain authentic.  The more frequent and the more genuine your interactions with other users, the greater the benefit. <br /><br />I love StumbleUpon for personal use more than anything.  I’d highly recommend checking it out for the fun of it.  Happy Stumbling!<br /><br />====================================================<br />At LiveMoreNow.net visit for personal development or just to have a laugh, the goal here is to help people impact positive change for themselves, their families, their communities....  <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkxDUpuZqZ1Srj3MW_sLNYw?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkxDUpuZqZ1Srj3MW_sLNYw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />AMAZON E-BOOKS: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.livemorenow.net/?p=247">http://www.livemorenow.net/?p=247</a><br /><br />LET'S CONNECT!<br />www.LiveMorenow.net<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/LiveMoreNow/1565663440313663">https://www.facebook.com/pages/LiveMoreNow/1565663440313663</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/livemorenow80/">https://www.pinterest.com/livemorenow80/</a>{% endraw %}
