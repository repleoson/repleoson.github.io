{% raw %}In this clip from his classes on the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali, Paramahamsa Prajnananandaji talks about how important it is for the mind to be able to move easily from grosser levels of understanding to increasingly deeper levels of subtlety if we want to understand the more subtle nature of things, “If you are engrossed in the gross then to understand the subtle is not so easy.”<br />Paramahamsaji explains that to be able to comprehend deeper spiritual truths we need to be sure that our mind and our understanding of life and the world, as well as our receptivity, are moving away from the world and from the things we experience through the senses and towards more subtle experiences and understandings. <br /> <br />Paramahamsa Prajnananandaji is a revered Kriya Yoga master who travels the world over teaching Kriya Yoga and how to practice spirituality in daily lives. His teachings cover a broad expanse of spiritual topics which include yoga, meditation, practical spirituality and also deep metaphorical interpretation of Vedanta and many scriptures like Bhagavad Gita, Yoga Sutra of Sage Patanjali, Durga Saptashati, different Upanishads. He is the current Guru in a long and unbroken lineage of Masters starting with Babaji Maharaj and including such spiritual giants as  Yogiraj Shri Shyamacharan Lahiri Mahashaya, Swami Shriyukteshwar Giri, Shri Bhupendranath Sanyal Mahashaya, Paramahamsa Yogananda the author of Autobiography of a Yogi, Swami Satyananda Giri, and Paramahamsa Hariharananda.
