{% raw %}In the small town of Riverton at the bottom of New Zealand’s South Island is Robert and Robyn Guyton’s amazing 23-year-old food forest. The 2-acre property has been transformed from a neglected piece of land into a thriving ecosystem of native and exotic trees where birds and insects live in abundance. Robert and Robyn are a huge inspiration to us, not only for their beautiful approach to healing the land and saving heritage trees and seeds, but for the way they’ve impacted on their local community.<br /><br />They’ve operated an environment centre in their town for over 20 years, where the community comes together to learn and discuss, buy produce and sit by the warm fire over a cuppa. We’ve even heard of folk who’ve up and moved to Riverton because they’re so inspired by the Guytons!<br /><br />South Coast Environment Society: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.sces.org.nz">http://www.sces.org.nz</a><br />Robert and Robyn on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheForestGardeners">https://www.facebook.com/TheForestGardeners</a><br /><br />** More about Happen Films **<br />Support us in making more films: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://happenfilms.com/donate">https://happenfilms.com/donate</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://happenfilms.com">https://happenfilms.com</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/happenfilms">https://twitter.com/happenfilms</a> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/happenfilms">https://instagram.com/happenfilms</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/happenfilms">https://facebook.com/happenfilms</a> <br /><br />** Screen our films in your community! **<br />While our short films are free to view online, you’ll need to purchase a license to hold a public screening.
