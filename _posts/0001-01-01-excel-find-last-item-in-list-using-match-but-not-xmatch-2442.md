{% raw %}There are a pair of well known Excel tricks with MATCH:<br />Find the last item in a long list of items that might contain empty cells.<br />Find the only number in a range of Error or Text values.<br />Excel tricksters have made use of these.<br />Why do they work?<br />And why do they not work with the new, superior XMATCH?<br /><br />Thanks to Jose for sending this question in.<br /><br />In this video, we dive in to how the binary search works in MATCH.<br /><br />We see how to adjust XMATCH to find the last item in a list.<br /><br />But there is no way to have XMATCH find the only number in a column of error cells. Which brings up the bigger question.... Why does this work at all with MATCH?  It violates the rules of binary search.<br /><br />Table of Contents<br />(0:00) Why can't XMATCH do what MATCH can do?<br />(0:30) Finding last item in list with MATCH<br />(1:30) How a binary search works<br />(5:30) Why doesn't the same trick work with XMATCH?<br />(7:55) Use MATCH to find only number in a range<br />(9:10) Excel Sort Sequence<br />(10:15) Why can't XMATCH find the only number?<br />(12:10) Why is MATCH finding the last item? Is it a bug?{% endraw %}
