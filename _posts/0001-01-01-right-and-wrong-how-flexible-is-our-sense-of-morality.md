{% raw %}Right and wrong, good and evil -- when viewing the world, our moral judgments often feel clear-cut and consistent. Research shows, however, that we're willing to be more forgiving and flexible with those who are socially close to us, while applying sterner judgments to those who are far away. <br /><br />Why do we make these exceptions? And how can we broaden our sense of morality to be more fair to people outside of our tribes?  Learn more about the science of morality in this interview with Dr. Liane Young, professor of psychology at Boston College. <br /><br />Still curious?
