{% raw %}He is one of England‚Äôs greatest ever goalkeepers, holding the record for the most number of caps, but behind the fame and football accolades Peter Shilton was living with a crippling addiction. For four decades the former England star led a double life as a gambling addict, one that he says nearly ruined him ‚Äúmentally, physically and financially‚Äù.
