Two species of animals that share the same African habitat. They have a completely different relationship between predator and prey than the rest. Baboons are known to be the arch enemies of leopards. They always try to disrupt the feline's life whenever they are outnumbered. These monkeys are very strong and highly social, so leopards, who are lone hunters, must balance the risk of getting hurt in the process.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Anaconda Suffocate A Jaguar , In An Attempt To Kill it !!<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For Business or copyright matters please contact us at: <br />(Pour communiquer et faire de la publicitÃ©)<br />chaabenechakib07@gmail.com<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-Several clips were used from the Videoblocks And Envato platform where we paid for its use.<br />Videoblocks And Envato is the complete stock solution for creators and businesses alike, providing an unlimited library of high-quality royalty-free video, audio and images through cost-effective subscription plans.<br />- The content we build with the aggregation of various sources on Youtube, Blog, Website. <br />It is difficult to guarantee all copyright protection, we always try to communicate with the owners rights to cooperate copyright even if there are still errors. <br />*Contact us if you don't want your footage been used, thank you<br />-Copyright Disclaimer-<br />Title 17, US Code (Sections 107-118 of the copyright law, Act 1976):<br />All media in this video is used for purpose of review &amp; commentary under terms of fair use. <br />All footage, &amp; images used belong to their respective companies.<br /><br />Fair use is a use permitted by copyright statute that might otherwise be infringing.{% endraw %}
