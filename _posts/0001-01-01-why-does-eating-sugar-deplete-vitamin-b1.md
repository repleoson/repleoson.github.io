Find out why. <br /><br />Timestamps<br />0:00 Introduction: Why sugar depletes vitamin B1<br />0:15 Causes of vitamin B1 deficiency <br />0:42 How the body uses vitamin B1<br />1:41 How vitamin B1 deficiency affects body tissues <br />2:42 Share your success story! <br /><br />In this video, we’re going to talk about carbohydrates and vitamin B1. <br /><br />Why do carbs deplete vitamin B1 in your body? Let’s find out!<br /><br />Vitamin B1 is necessary for the breakdown of carbohydrates. This process is known as carbohydrate catabolism. <br /><br />So the more carbohydrates that you consume, the more your body needs vitamin B1 for the metabolism of carbs. <br /><br />When you’re eating a large number of carbs, your vitamin B1 intake often can’t keep up. <br /><br />Other potential causes of vitamin B1 deficiency are:<br />• Alcohol<br />• Dextrose<br />• Stress<br />• Diabetes <br /><br />Vitamin B1 is critical for:<br />• Biochemical pathways<br />• Neurotransmitters <br />• Nucleic acids<br />• Fatty acids<br />• Steroids <br />• Defending against oxidative stress<br /><br />Diabetics often experience issues related to vitamin B1 deficiency, such as peripheral neuropathy, neuritis, and other forms of nerve damage. Benfotiamine may help with these issues. Benfotiamine is a special form of fat-soluble vitamin B1. <br /><br />The tissues that are most sensitive to vitamin B1 deficiency are:<br />1. Nerves/brain tissue<br />Symptoms include: <br /> • Neuritis<br /> • Neuropathy<br /> • Anxiety<br /> • Agitation <br /> • Dementia<br /> • Confusion<br /> • Nightmares<br /><br />2. Heart tissue<br />Symptoms include:<br /> • Increased heart rate<br /> • Edema<br /> • Heart failure <br /><br />The best natural source of vitamin B1 is nutritional yeast. <br /><br />In summary, vitamin B1 is a crucial nutrient. It’s important to replenish your vitamin B1 and avoid high-carb diets. <br /><br />Healthy Keto is the best diet for avoiding carbohydrates and sugar.
