Dramatic colour film footage of aerial combat combined with contemporary interviews will illustrate that the events of seventy years ago still resonate. A gripping account featuring the pilots who defended Britain in the summer of 1940 and the strong arm behind the shield, a nation united to defend its freedom and pave the way for eventual victory.<br /><br />üì∫  It's like Netflix for history...
