{% raw %}I PRANKED MY FRIENDS IN MINECRAFT AS A D-CLASS TEST SUBJECT!<br />SUB: @Raszius TV @Sxardeath Kingsfire and @Lunus <br /><br />Class D personnel are expendable personnel used to handle extremely hazardous anomalies and are not allowed to come into contact with Class A or Class B personnel. Class D personnel are typically drawn worldwide from the ranks of prison inmates convicted of violent crimes, especially those on death row. In times of duress, Protocol 12 may be enacted, which allows recruitment from other sources ‚Äî such as political prisoners, refugee populations, and other civilian sources ‚Äî that can be transferred into Foundation custody under plausibly deniable circumstances. Class D personnel are to be given regular mandatory psychiatric evaluations and are to be administered an amnestic of at least Class B strength or terminated at the end of the month at the discretion of on-site security or medical staff. In the event of a catastrophic site event, Class D personnel are to be terminated immediately except as deemed necessary by on-site security personnel.<br />Class-D (&quot;Disposable Class&quot;) personnel are expendable individuals used for testing SCPs, notably Keter-class objects. They are unwillingly recruited by the SCP Foundation worldwide and are usually death row inmates. In times of duress, the Foundation will recruit individuals from civilian sources or inmates incarcerated of lesser crimes. Civilians can also 'sign up' to be part of the Class-D program at the Foundation. Class-D personnel are primarily used as test subjects for studying and investigating SCPs. This usually involves risking the life of the Class-D for the sake of ensuring research.<br /><br />Follow me on:<br />Instagramüì∏: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/itsFreyr">https://www.instagram.com/itsFreyr</a><br />Patreonüí≤: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/FreyrYT">https://www.patreon.com/FreyrYT</a><br />Discordüïµ: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/vZFA2Et">https://discord.gg/vZFA2Et</a><br />Twitterüê¶: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/itsFreyr">https://twitter.com/itsFreyr</a><br />Twitchüì¢: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/itsFreyr">https://www.twitch.tv/itsFreyr</a><br /><br />Musicüéµ: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.purple-planet.com">https://www.purple-planet.com</a><br />Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br /><br />#DarkNet{% endraw %}
