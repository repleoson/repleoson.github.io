{% raw %}Time to talk color trends for 2022!  In this video I go over the color palettes for 2022 from Benjamin Moore, Behr, Sherwin Williams and PPG including their colors of the year!  Here's a hint, everyone is seeing GREEN this year!  All the big paint brands are predicting green is going to be the hot, trendy color for 2022.  However there are some differences between how green is used in interior designs from each of these companies... so stay tuned as I break down all the similarities and differences in these very interesting palettes!<br /><br />By the way, if you want to learn more about each palette, go check out James @The Paint People as he does such a good job breaking down these palettes as well!<br /><br />‚è±   Timestamps:<br />00:00 - Colors of the Year Revealed!<br />01:05 - Benjamin Moore Color Palette<br />01:24 - Benjamin Moor Color of the Year - October Mist<br />03:19 - Morning Dew<br />04:01 - Fernwood Green<br />04:55 - Smoky Green<br />05:37 - Gloucester Sage<br />06:21 - High Park<br />07:27 - Collector's Item<br />08:15 - Steam<br />08:49 - Pale Moon<br />09:49 - Natural Linen<br />10:55 - Mysterious<br />12:04 - Wildflower<br />12:58 - Venetian Portico<br />14:02 - Behr Color Palette<br />14:50 - Behr Color of the Year - Breezeway<br />15:39 - Sunwashed Brick<br />16:05 - Whisper White<br />16:33 - Nightingale Grey<br />17:12 - Sherwin Williams Color of the Year - Evergreen Fog<br />19:47 - PPG Color of the Year - Olive Sprig<br /><br />üõç  Shop Your Design Style on My Amazon Store!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/mkmwJB">https://geni.us/mkmwJB</a><br /><br />üë®‚Äçüíª.
