{% raw %}Welcome to my channel!<br />BUFFPOP is a small jazz ensemble from Norway. We have been working together since 2011, and have so far released three albums. Each album has its own sound, but the music can be described as acoustic jazz with hints of folk-rock. Our main goal is to create a warm atmosphere, where people feel good about themselves and each other - just like in our concerts!<br />All rights belong to our team.<br />Please do not re-upload<br />Please subscribe to our channel for more videos!<br />#BUFFPOPnightjazz #BUFFPOPcalmjazz #BUFFPOP{% endraw %}
