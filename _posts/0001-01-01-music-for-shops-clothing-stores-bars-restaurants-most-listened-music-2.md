So, Our customers feel at home with us and like to buy more from us. Why?<br /><br />Perhaps you know the feeling of sneaking into a store on tiptoe so as not to &quot;disturb&quot; the quiet environment and the vendors? With music, your customers can easily explore your business as they feel less seen.<br /><br />Humans respond positively to melodies and rhythm. Music creates and influences moods:<br />Slow, quiet background music, especially in the minor key, allows humans to stay longer in the store and can lead to higher sales.<br /><br />Loud music allows us to move faster, so we can also get out of business faster.<br />Fast music can have an energizing effect, lift your spirits, and also lead to a faster exit.<br /><br />You want your customers to visit your store in the most pleasant way possible, don't you? Because when the customer feels comfortable, he likes to stay and buy more or more spontaneously. As a retailer, you have certainly planned this well:<br /><br />With the optimal store fixtures,<br />a well thought out product presentation<br />and a coordinated color scheme<br /><br />In addition to the opportunity to touch and taste the products, it increases the time your customers spend in the store.<br /><br />Music can also have a positive effect, if it's the right combination.
