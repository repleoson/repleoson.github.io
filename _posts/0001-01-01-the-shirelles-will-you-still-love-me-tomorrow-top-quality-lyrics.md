{% raw %}Tonight you're mine completely<br />You give you love so sweetly<br />Tonight the light of love is in your eyes<br />But will you love me tomorrow?<br /><br />Is this a lasting treasure<br />Or just a moment's pleasure?<br />Can I believe the magic of your sighs?<br />Will you still love me tomorrow?<br /><br />Tonight with words unspoken<br />You say that I'm the only one<br />But will my heart be broken<br />When the night meets the morning sun?<br /><br />I'd like to know that your love<br />Is love I can be sure of<br />So tell me now, and I won't ask again<br />Will you still love me tomorrow?<br /><br />(INSTRUMENTAL)<br /><br />So tell me now, and I won't ask again<br />Will you still love me tomorrow?<br />Will you still love me tomorrow?<br />Will you still love me tomorrow?{% endraw %}
