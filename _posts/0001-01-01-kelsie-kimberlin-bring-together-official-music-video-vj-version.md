{% raw %}ENJOY BRING TOGETHER ON ALL MAJOR DIGITAL PLATFORMS <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gate.fm/YkMTtqp">https://www.gate.fm/YkMTtqp</a><br /><br />There is so much more that binds us all together than breaks us apart, and that is why I wrote Bring Together.  It is time that we all overcome our differences so we can all live happier lives with brighter futures.  I wanted to release this song now in the hope that it might play a small part in reducing our divisions with more emphasis on empathy and compassion.  <br /> <br />With the COVID lockdown, I could not create the video I wanted for this song, but I was able to &quot;bring together&quot; footage from all my other released and unreleased videos in a very cool mashup.  I hope you enjoy it.
