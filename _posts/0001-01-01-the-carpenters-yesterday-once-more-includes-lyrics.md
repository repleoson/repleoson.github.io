{% raw %}Montage of images along with the classic song &quot;Yesterday Once More&quot; from The Carpenters<br /><br />R.I.P Karen Carpenter<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />When I was young<br />I'd listen to the radio<br />Waitin' for my favorite songs<br />Waiting they played I'd sing along<br />It made me smile<br /><br />Those were such happy times<br />And not so long ago<br />How I wondered where they'd gone<br />But they're back again<br />Just like a long lost friend<br />All the songs I loved so well<br /><br />(*) every sha-la-la-la<br />Every wo-wo-wo<br />Still shines<br />Every shing-a-ling-a-ling<br />That they're starting to sing's<br />So fine<br /><br />When they get to the part<br />Where he's breakin' her heart<br />It can really make me cry<br />Just like before<br />It's yesterday once more<br /><br />Lookin' back on how it was<br />In years gone by<br />And the good times that I had<br />Makes today seem rather sad<br />So much has changed<br /><br />It was songs of love that<br />I would sing to then<br />And I'd memorize each word<br />Those old melodies<br />Still sound so good to me<br />As they melt the years away<br /><br />Repeat (*)<br /><br />All my best memories<br />Come back clearly to me<br />Some can even make me cry<br />Just like before<br />It's yesterday once more<br /><br />(*) Repeat{% endraw %}
