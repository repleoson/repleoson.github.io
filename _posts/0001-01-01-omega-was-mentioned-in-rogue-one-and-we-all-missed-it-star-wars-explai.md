{% raw %}Patreon âœ… : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsMeg">https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsMeg</a> <br /><br />In this Star Wars theory video, we talk about Omega from the Bad Batch who was in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Mount Tantiss is back in canon after Order 66 in the Bad Batch finale. This will tie into Thrawn, The Mandalorian and Palpatine. We talk about how why the Empire might be after her and how this connects to the other Disney+ Lucasfilm series including the Mandalorian by Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni, Star Wars: Ahsoka and the Andor series. Omega made friends with Hera Syndulla and given her uncertain DNA and mysterious backstory, there is more to her than what Tech revealed - that she is a Jango Fett clone like Boba Fett. <br /><br />#StarWars #TheBadBatch #TheMandalorian{% endraw %}
