{% raw %}As surgeons, our number one priority is our patients. We look out for our patients and their best interests and we choose the IOLs that best matches with their anatomy, biometry, and their desires for visual function. In this regard, it is important for you as a surgeon to learn about a wide range of different IOL options and to gain experience in using them. We want more tools in the toolbox, not fewer. And we want to expand the range of options available to our patients. Do not limit yourself to just the IOLs from one company. Be loyal to  your patients and to yourself. This video explains my rationale for using so many different IOLs. Sure, I may have a fastball that I like to throw most of the time, but I want to have experience in throwing all different kinds of pitches. There are surgeons who just love the Alcon monofocals (AcrySof and now Clareon), those who just love the J&amp;J (formerly Abbott, formerly AMO) monofocals (Tecnis/Eyhance), and those who just love the B&amp;L monofocals (EnVista, Akreos, and even SofPort). And there are other manufacturers as well: Hoya, Rayner, Zeiss, and more.{% endraw %}
