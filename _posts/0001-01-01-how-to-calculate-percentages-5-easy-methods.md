What percent of your bananas have you eaten? Divide the number of bananas you ate (one) by the number of bananas that make 100% (seven). But since we’re after the percent, you’ll need to multiply the result by 100% as well. <br />-What percentage of your puppies will you keep and what percent will you give away, given that you have 6 puppies and can only keep 2 of them?<br />-Imagine that you borrowed $100 from a friend, and he's going to charge you an interest rate of 3% a day. First off, you have to multiply 3 by 0.01, which is 0.03. That’s 3% in its decimal form. Then, you multiply the $100 that you borrowed (which makes 100% in this case) by 0.03. In the end, you’re paying $3 dollars a day in interest.<br />-There are 850 books in your local library. The library is going out of business and has decided to give 40% of their books to a nearby school. How many books will the school get?<br />-Here’s what you have to do to figure out how much you’d pay for a $200 item that’s on 30% sale. The first step is to find out the opposite of the discounted percent, so take 100% minus 30% to get 70%. Here’s where the second formula that we've just discussed comes in. Multiply 70 by 0.01, which is 0.7. Take that 0.7 times the initial price of $200. That means the new price is $140.<br />-How much does a $16 album cost if it’s at 70% off?<br />-Whenever you need to find 25% of something or you already know 25% of a whole, you can simply divide or multiply the initial number by 4.<br />-How many pieces of jewelry did Mrs. Fernandez buy with her own money given that she paid for 25% of 300 pieces?<br />-How much does the bike of your dream cost if you have $400 but that’s just 25% of its price?<br />-When you need to find 5% of something, find 10% instead and split the result in half. This trick works with 15% as well: find 10%, halve it, and add that half to the result. If you need 25%, find 50% and divide it by two.<br />-There are 300 kids in a camp, but 75% of them went home early. So, how many children didn’t stick it out for the whole camp session? <br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br /><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
