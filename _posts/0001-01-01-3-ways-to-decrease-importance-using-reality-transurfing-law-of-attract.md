Transcript below...... <br /><br />This video I'm going to be sharing with you three ways to decrease importance in order to really create what you want in your life. This is a Reality Transurfing concept that changed my life and that I think can absolutely transform yours and how to apply it. <br /><br />Welcome back to another video. My name is Aaron and I help people expand their consciousness. Now this video we're going to be going more in detail to that of reality trans surfing which as many of you know is a concept I've been sharing a lot in the channel. It's completely changed my life in the way that I see the whole you know what I would call the manifestation process. And it has to do with a more so philosophy than anything else more so than just like a manifestation process. It's a way for seeing the world. <br /><br />And when you start to kind of adopt some of the principles that are within this concept are within this process. What happens is as you start to feel differently you start to understand more of how to follow your heart and more of you know when things are happening you kind of see that there's a certain imbalance in energy and it makes him much more aware of how to go about actually changing that. So for the first part of this I want to explain a little bit of a context of what reality TV and surfing is. Just to give you guys you know an understanding that you know what I'm talking about when I explained why we must let go of importance and decrease the level of it. And reality and surfing is a book that was written in Russia by quantum physicist quantum physicist named Vadim Zealand. Now it's now being translated to many different languages.

This is called the alternative space. When we make choices when we make decisions we are gliding and shifting through these different parallel realities. Now the idea with time is that we have this continuous memory so we're able to piece together and in general there's a whole bunch of us having a collective experience on Earth. So we are shifting through these different parallel realities seemingly together but we create our own layer we create our own experience of it through our own eyes and through our own definitions and our perceptions. Now one of the most powerful parts of understanding reality and surfing is to simply set more intentions. The idea is that desire in itself is not that powerful if I met a desire to put my hand right now and I didn't do it then the desire is meaningless but unless if that desire leads me to set the intention to put my hand up then that's transferred into action and then it becomes something powerful because I intended for it. So set intentions because intentions are what shifts you to the life tracks of what you want to experience. Now the idea under there is this concept called pendulum's...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Song<br />Adventures by A Himitsu <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/a-himitsu">https://soundcloud.com/a-himitsu</a><br />Creative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported— CC BY 3.0 <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...</a><br />Music released by Argofox <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/8BXNwnxaVQE">https://youtu.be/8BXNwnxaVQE</a><br />Music provided by Audio Library <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/MkNeIUgNPQ8">https://youtu.be/MkNeIUgNPQ8</a><br /><br /><br />This video is about 3 Ways to Decrease Importance using Reality Transurfing{% endraw %}
