{% raw %}Lyrics:<br />If I could go back to the day we met<br />I would probably do it all over again<br />And I would choose not to be your friend<br />When you ask me, I'd just say I got a man<br />It wouldn't be no dates<br />It would be no staying late, at my house<br />It would be no watching movies on my couch<br />Shit went left, and now I'm just trying to figure out<br />Said &quot;You'd always be my baby&quot; then you bounced<br /><br />How you gonna up and leave like that?<br />When I gave you all I had<br />I gave you the real me<br />Told you all my feelings<br />And you gonna turn around and front like you don't feel me<br />I put that on my life that I ain't see this coming<br />Opened up my heart I should've never let you come in<br />But I wish you well though<br />That's all I could tell you<br />Maybe in your next life you'll find everything you wanted<br /><br />I never thought that loving you would cause me pain<br />I'll never put a man before myself again<br />You shoulda told me that you was uncertain<br />&quot;This ain't what I wanted, this ain't working.&quot;<br />You was dead ass my baby, loved the shit out of you crazy<br />Shit is crazy how you could just turn around and try to play me<br />Boy, I know that we been going through some things<br />But just keep it real is all I'm saying <br /><br />I was the one loving you<br />I was the one cuffing you<br />Call me when you need me<br />I was the one coming through<br />Why didn't you believe in us?<br />How come you just couldn't love?<br />It wasn't that you didn't care<br />You just wasn't good enough<br /><br />How you gonna up and leave like that?<br />When I gave you all I had<br />I gave you the real me<br />Told you all my feelings<br />And you gonna turn around and front like you don't feel me<br />I put that on my life that I ain't see this coming<br />Opened up my heart I should've never let you come in<br />But I wish you well though<br />That's all I could tell you<br />Maybe in your next life you'll find everything you wanted.{% endraw %}
