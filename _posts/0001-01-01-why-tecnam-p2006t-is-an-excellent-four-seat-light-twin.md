{% raw %}Work on the P2006T started back in the early 2000s, when Tecnam decided to build their first twin-engine aircraft. Speaking of design, the P2006T is a twin-engine high wing all-metal aircraft with, a single tail fin, and it is the lightest twin-engine certified aircraft available. This airplane is beautiful, it is a good example of Italian excellence, it is so beautiful that most of its counterparts look uninspiring, more like tractors. It is not just beautiful for the sake of eye appeal; every inch of this sleek design contributes to its aerodynamic quality. <br /><br />#Tecnam #TecnamP2006T #CostruzioniAeronauticheTecnam<br />_________________________________________________<br />The Team:<br />Oscar Obierefu (Creative Executive)<br />Nneji Valentine (Video Editor)<br />Voiceover by Tomislav Krevzelj: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fiverr.com/share/r9qGrP">https://www.fiverr.com/share/r9qGrP</a><br />Written by Ishika Makkar: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fiverr.com/s2/2ec9e46162">https://www.fiverr.com/s2/2ec9e46162</a> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fiverr.com/s2/f7ebe16b3a">https://www.fiverr.com/s2/f7ebe16b3a</a><br />_________________________________________________<br />You can Support us on Patreon here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/dwaynesaviation">https://www.patreon.com/dwaynesaviation</a><br />_________________________________________________<br />To contact me directly: Dashboardglobal@techie.com <br />_________________________________________________<br />Our channel is about Aviation.<br />We make the best educational aviation videos you've ever seen; my videos are designed to clear misunderstandings about airplanes and explain complicated aviation topics in a simple way.{% endraw %}
