{% raw %}What‚Äôs the difference between great developers and good developers? It‚Äôs not about language or tools, it is a collection of other skills and attributes. How to be good at programming is about a lot more than only a good grasp of syntax or an encyclopaedic knowledge of libraries and frameworks. To learn to program well, is something that takes a long time and requires some talent, but the people who are great at it do seem to share some skills.<br /><br />In this episode Dave Farley, who has worked with many great programmers, describes what he sees as the difference between the people that seem to do a great job and those that don‚Äôt. This is about more than only programming tips, but there are some of those here too, and it is not always how we learn to program, it is about how we approach problems and construct solutions that we can live with and evolve over time and how we deal with other people while we are doing it. <br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />üìö BOOKS:<br /><br />üìñ Dave‚Äôs NEW BOOK &quot;Modern Software Engineering&quot; is now available on <br />Kindle ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3DwdwT3">https://amzn.to/3DwdwT3</a><br />(Paperback version available soon)<br />In this book, Dave brings together his ideas and proven techniques to describe a durable, coherent and foundational approach to effective software development, for programmers, managers and technical leads, at all levels of experience.<br /><br />üìñ &quot;Continuous Delivery Pipelines&quot; by Dave Farley<br />paperback ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3gIULlA">https://amzn.to/3gIULlA</a><br />ebook version ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines">https://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines</a><br /><br />üìñ The original, award-winning &quot;Continuous Delivery&quot; book by Dave Farley and Jez Humble <br />‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WxRYmx">https://amzn.to/2WxRYmx</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Also from Dave:<br /><br />üéì CD TRAINING COURSES  ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/DFTraining">https://bit.ly/DFTraining</a><br /><br />üìß JOIN CD MAIL LIST üìß<br />Keep up to date with the latest discussions, free &quot;How To...&quot; guides, events, online courses and exclusive offers. ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/MailListCD">https://bit.ly/MailListCD</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />LINKS:<br /><br />Punched Cards ‚û°Ô∏è  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />CHANNEL SPONSORS:<br /><br />Equal Experts is a product software development consultancy with a network of over 1,000 experienced technology consultants globally.
