Yeah, well... I thought a lot about this in relationship to a couple of ancient ideas—the one Mesopotamian idea—characterization of Marduk who is the highest Mesopotamian deity. It was Marduk who carved up the Goddess of Chaos Tiamat into pieces and made the world out of her pieces. So Marduk is the force that confronts chaos and builds habitable order like the logos in Genesis. And one of Marduk's attributes was that he had eyes all the way around his head. Then there's Horus the Egyptian god who's the famous eye and Horus is really a deification of attention, I would say. And there's a difference between attention and thinking. Like, let me give you an example. So thinking seems to be instrumental, mostly. People also often say to me, “Well what's your—what's your strategy when you go into an interview?” And the answer is—well I don't have a strategy when I go into an interview because I'm there to have a conversation. And I'm not sure where the conversation will go and I'm willing to let it go wherever it goes. I'm not there to sell books although I'm perfectly happy if more books sell because obviously I wrote a book and I want people to read it and there's a whole enterprise behind it and so it's also my responsibility to do the marketing properly but I'm not going to do these interviews to sell books or to promote myself or—I don't have a strategic goal in mind except that I'm going to have a conversation and I'm going to say what I think and take the consequences because I assume that if I say something and I believe it's true then the consequences are as positive as they can be regardless of how they look at the time. And that's an issue of faith because I believe that the habitable order is generated by spoken truth. I believe that; I think that's the truest thing I know. And so I go into the interview—and I did this in my clinical practice and I try to do this when I'm talking to people too—is that, I'm not thinking about where the conversation is going or what point I want to make or what I want the outcome to be—any of that—I just let that go. You know, it's within this broader framework of assuming that the truth is the most effective means of progressing and then I pay attention. And what happens when you pay attention is that, well, you're watching a person. This is a great treatment for social anxiety, by the way, because if you're socially anxious you tend not to pay attention to the person. Pay attention to who you're talking to. Watch them like a hawk. Like, not paranoid or anything like that and not too intently because you make them uncomfortable but intently pay attention to what they're saying, to how they look, to their facial gestures—all of that. Look at their face and watch and listen and try to understand what they're saying...<br />▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂<br /><br />Fair Use Disclaimer:<br /><br />Our purpose is to produce quality, educational and motivational video content, and to share it with our viewers.<br /><br />This video has no negative impact on the original works.<br />This video is used for educational purposes.<br />This video is transformative in nature.<br />This channel’s owner claims no copyright, and cannot be held accountable.<br /><br />If you are the legal content owner of any videos used here and would like them removed, please contact wordtothewise.yt@gmail.com.
