{% raw %}The Producers is a movie about failing producer Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane) and his accountant, Leo Bloom (Matthew Broderick), who scam a group of elderly women out of their nest eggs by convincing them to invest in a horrendously offensive Third Reich-themed musical secretly intended to bomb the moment it opens.<br /><br />But when high-brow Broadway audiences mistakenly assume &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot; is a satire, Bialystock finds himself with the critical acclaim that has long eluded him -- and the biggest hit of his career.<br /><br />This scene is the production of the play itself, interspersed with scenes of the audience.<br /><br />Special thanks to L weiwei for the Chinese subtitles!
