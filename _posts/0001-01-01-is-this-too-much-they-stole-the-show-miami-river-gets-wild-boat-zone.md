{% raw %}The Miami River evolved over thousands of years from a tidal channel into a freshwater stream that carried water from the Everglades to Biscayne Bay. It is the oldest natural landmark in Southeast Florida. The 5.5-mile (8.9 km) long river flows from the terminus of the Miami Canal at Miami International Airport to Biscayne Bay. The 15-foot deep navigable waterway's shoreline features public riverwalks, city parks, over 7,000 new residential units, 17 restaurants, and 16 historic sites.<br />__________<br />Uncensored Content In Patreon<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/boatzone">https://www.patreon.com/boatzone</a><br />__________<br />This video is sponsored by the following sponsors:<br /><br />UniVista Insurance<br />Free Quotes-Call Now 786.272.9414<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.univistainsurance.com/bz-video1">https://www.univistainsurance.com/bz-video1</a><br /><br />SunGlass Outlet<br />Leading destination for discounted brand name sunglasses.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sunglassoutlet.com">https://www.sunglassoutlet.com</a><br /><br />Cafe El Mio <br />Authentic Cuban Coffee 786.671.6785<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cafeelmio.com">https://www.cafeelmio.com</a> <br /><br />Interested in advertise your business with us?
