{% raw %}More animal warriors compete in the world’s lush jungles and dense forests than anywhere else on the planet. Home to 80 % of all species land, it’s a place riddled with hiding places and elaborate escape routes. This complex hunting arena demands some of the deadliest weaponry. <br /><br />Armed with sixty razor-sharp teeth and the ability to plan an attack, the female saltwater crocodile is one of the world’s most ferocious predators. However her prey also comes well-armed, protected by many cautious eyes and ears they can quickly melt back into the jungle. Tracking a herd of bearded pigs under the water, she waits for the perfect moment to launch her ambush. <br /><br />Standing out from the crowd to attract a mate also presents its challenges.
