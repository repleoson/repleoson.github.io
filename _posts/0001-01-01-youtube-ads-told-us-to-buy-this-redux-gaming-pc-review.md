It's a comprehensive review of a pre-built gaming PC in the $1300 price range, competing with a dense section of the market that is fiercely crowded with competition. That means comparing the Redux PC to the likes of iBUYPOWER, Cyberpower, ABS, Skytech, HP, and Dell, among others.<br /><br /><br />Like our content?
