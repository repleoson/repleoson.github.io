{% raw %}Everyone wants America’s education system to do better. Ex-Googler Max Ventilla has a radical idea for how to make it work more like a social network. Ventilla’s AltSchool is building a highly-personalized education experience that gets better and cheaper as more students use it. Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://freeth.ink/youtube-subscribe-altschool">https://freeth.ink/youtube-subscribe-altschool</a><br /><br />In a decade, AltSchool may not have just built some new schools but rather a new school system that all will be able to join. What do you think: is this the future of schools or an idea that won't succeed? Let us know what you think about education reform in the comments and subscribe to Freethink for more videos on the cutting edge of social and technological change.{% endraw %}
