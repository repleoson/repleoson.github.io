(in the negative, use â€˜donâ€™tâ€™ or â€˜doesnâ€™tâ€™)<br />Example: Do you have to work tomorrow? (use â€˜doâ€™ or â€˜doesâ€™ to form a question)<br />Example: We had to leave early yesterday. (in the past, use â€˜had toâ€™)<br />Example: If I donâ€™t go to university, I will have to get a job. (â€˜will have toâ€™ in the future tense.)<br /><br />Have got to:  means a strong obligation<br />.<br />Example: Iâ€™ve got to finish my homework. <br />Example: We havenâ€™t got to pay for the food. (use â€˜have notâ€™ in the negative)<br />Example: Have you got to go to work tomorrow? (to make a question, place â€˜haveâ€™ or â€˜hasâ€™ before the subject)<br />Example: I have got to call my mom tomorrow. (use â€˜have got toâ€™ for an action to take place in the future. Do not use â€˜will have got toâ€™<br />Example: You canâ€™t be serious. Youâ€™ve got to be kidding. <br />Example: This has got to be your shirt. Itâ€™s definitely not mine. <br />The last two examples show that the speaker is certain about something. You can use â€˜have gotâ€™ when you are certain about what you are saying.<br /><br />We hope this advanced English grammar lesson has helped you clear your confusion about using â€˜have toâ€™ and â€˜have got toâ€™ correctly in English.
