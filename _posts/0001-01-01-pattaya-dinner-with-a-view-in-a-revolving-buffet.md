{% raw %}Today we go to the tallest building in Pattaya for dinner.  There is a restaurant on the 54th floor of Pratumnak Tower which features a revolving buffet with spectacular views.  I feel the buffet is a good value and it proves to be one of the best places to spend an evening in Pattaya right now. <br /><br />#Pattaya #Thailand #Rides4Kickz #PattayaThailand{% endraw %}
