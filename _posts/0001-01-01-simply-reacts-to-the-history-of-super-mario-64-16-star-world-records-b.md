Mizkif reacts? Whatever it is, its time for some Super Mario 64 speedrunning. Summoning Salt put out another banger for the speedrunning mario community &amp; covers the Super Mario 64 16 Star World World Record History. sm64 speedruns are cool, especially Simply Super Mario 64 120 World Record. Cheese speedrunning has covered this video, but maybe I can offer a different perspective and get some views. Mario speedruns are cool. Mario 64 speedrun world record are also cool. This description is also also cool.<br /><br />#mario #speedrun #simply{% endraw %}
