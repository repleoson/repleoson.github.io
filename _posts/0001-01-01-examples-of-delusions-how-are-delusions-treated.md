{% raw %}This video answers the question: Can I give some examples of delusions as they might be seen by mental health counselors in their work?<br />There's a lot of confusion about delusions and when something rises to the level of delusional. A delusion is a fixed false belief that doesn't change in light of conflicting evidence. Delusions get confused with hallucinations. Hallucinations represent a separate construct: this is when somebody sees something other people can't see or hears or something other people can't hear or otherwise senses something other people cannot sense. Oftentimes delusions and hallucinations go together like in certain disorders, but they don't necessarily have to appear together. <br /><br />Delusions are consistent with the concept of psychosis - they break from reality. When someone is psychotic, 65% of the time we would see the delusions. <br />Certain mental disorders may be associated with delusions: schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder.<br /><br />Mehl, S., Schlier, B., &amp; Lincoln, T.
