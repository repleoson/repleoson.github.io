{% raw %}1047 I’M LOOKING AHEAD <br />Elizabeth Bishop 2007 Key B♭/C/D<br /><br />CHORUS<br />I'm looking ahead to that glorious city <br />Where I'll shake the hands of those who've gone before me <br />I can still feel the same tender hand that's carrying me <br />Will lead me home so Lord I'm looking ahead <br /><br />Living in a world of insanity <br />We're surrounded by the dead they are all asleep <br />But under the Easter seal thank God we're quickened and awakened Now the master is here the son has risen <br />He's no longer the hidden Messiah but he has appeared <br />Now to the promise of a second coming I'm looking ahead <br /><br />So many among us are hurting <br />They're wounded in the battle <br />Lord they are dying <br />Brothers take each others hand <br />Sisters do the same thing too <br />Lift each other in prayer we will make it through <br />And though skin worms may destroy this body <br />I've got another one waiting for me <br />So Lord fill my soul with your Holy Ghost <br />Cleanse me and make me whole.<br /><br />BRIDGE<br />I am looking to my perfect sacrifice <br />To my redeemer the Lord Jesus Christ <br />No more sickness no more trials for me <br />To that provided place that Jesus built for me <br />My faith is settled, my theophany <br />To that provided place that's prepared for me <br /><br />CHORUS<br /><br />BRIDGE <br />Swing low, swing low, swing low, sweet chariot <br />In just a little while we'll shake our prophet's hand <br />In just a little while we'll walk the streets of gold <br />Hallelujah we'll meet the saints of all the ages..................{% endraw %}
