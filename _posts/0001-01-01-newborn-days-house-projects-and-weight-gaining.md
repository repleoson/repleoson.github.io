{% raw %}The suction pump - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3BuaGMY">https://amzn.to/3BuaGMY</a><br />(I find this really helped with the engorgement phase, because it catches the extra let-down milk and helps baby be able to latch on a little easier.  But it is probably more foremilk and not as much hindmilk.  Because Peace is having trouble gaining weight, I switched to a traditional pump to get more of that fatty milk to top her off with.  Just FYI!  Still my favorite baby product!)<br /><br />Some of our most-asked-for videos...<br />How we met - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_4-j1pMsoc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_4-j1pMsoc</a><br />Our favorite bread recipe - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyFmqXzmPUo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyFmqXzmPUo</a><br />Granola recipe - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1NPPNFX7kY&amp;t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1NPPNFX7kY&amp;t=1s</a><br />Ranch recipe - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LEwsqyxAyI&amp;t=8s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LEwsqyxAyI&amp;t=8s</a><br /><br />To sponsor a child through COMPASSION INTERNATIONAL, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.compassion.com/ourtribeofmany">https://www.compassion.com/ourtribeofmany</a><br /><br />My Amazon FAVORITE THINGS - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/ourtribeof10">https://www.amazon.com/shop/ourtribeof10</a><br />As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.<br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />Solo<br />Sarah <br />Judah - 17<br />Belle (Isabelle) - 16<br />Luka - 14<br />Micah - 13<br />Tori (Victory) - 10<br />Eli - 9<br />Noelle - 6<br />Hope - 4<br />Destiny - 3<br />Seth - 1<br />Peace - 2 weeks old{% endraw %}
