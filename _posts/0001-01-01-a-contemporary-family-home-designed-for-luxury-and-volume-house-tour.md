{% raw %}North House by mckimm is a contemporary family home, celebrating functionality and grandeur. Despite its large volume and size, North House is a sanctuary, filled with intimate detailing and soul.<br /><br />Designed by Lorenzo Garizio, the site offers a sense of mystery, heightened by the immediate dramatic action of walking across a bridge to access the front door. Journeying over the courtyard below, there is a real sense of depth to the property; this is made more apparent as, in this moment, the eye has the opportunity to span across the length of the home. This feature gives the illusion of an ever-expanding site, made more tangible by the attachment of a second property at the rear of the site, which now hosts a tennis court.<br /><br />The heavy-set materials used, specifically the coolness of concrete, set the home apart. The client was interested in incorporating arches into the property; mckimm integrated this feature with a twist, whether it be in the form of curves, circles, skylights or cut-outs. The modern interpretation of arches dominates the design in a way that complements the use of harder materials and ignites the space to become fluid and delicate.<br /><br />Collaboration between mckimm and the clients saw a consolidation of ideas that developed into the functional flow of North House. The clients were involved in the design process â€“ the result is a family home that works for day-to-day living.<br /><br />Architecture, Interior Design and Construction by mckimm.<br />Photography by Dave Kulesza. <br />Filmed and Edited by Cheer Squad Film Co. <br />Production by The Local Project. <br /><br />#FamilyHome #NorthHouse #HouseTour{% endraw %}
