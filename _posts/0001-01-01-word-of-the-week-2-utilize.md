{% raw %}Welcome to General Grammar! In this episode, Mr. Goodie Grammar serves some fresh Word of the Week brew! This week’s word is UTILIZE.<br /><br />Challenge: Use UTILIZE in a sentence, and post it in the comments section. If it’s funny and uses the word correctly, we will give you a shout-out in an upcoming episode.<br /><br />Do you want even more fun content? Sign up on www.mrgoodiegrammar.com to receive extended episodes, worksheets, PowerPoints, and exclusive video quizzes. Become a Grammar Goodie today! <br /><br />Note: Some of these episodes have outrageous and wacky humor that contains--but not limited to--potential demonic possession, going to the bathroom in bottles, an addiction to sniffing gasoline, kidney harvesting, slang acronyms, etc. Mind you, these are all in jest and meant to reinforce the concepts with memorable humor (none of the episodes have any vulgarities or anything controversial, just ridiculousness). Please review each video ahead of time and determine whether or not the examples are the type of humor for your class/age-group. Again, these are wacky grammar and vocabulary videos for upper-middle and high school students.
