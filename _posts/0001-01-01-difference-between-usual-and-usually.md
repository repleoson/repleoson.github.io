{% raw %}www.englishlessonviaskype.com - In this English lesson we are talking about USUAL and USUALLY. USUAL as an adjective is used with a noun. USUALLY is an adverb and we use it with a verb. How do we use USUAL and USUALLY in a sentence? <br /><br />~~~TRANSCRIPT~~~<br />Hi there. Welcome to Harry's World of Words and Phrases and English in a Minute. We're now going to look at the word USUAL which is an adjective and USUALLY the adverb. And remember with adjectives and adverbs we can't use them together. The adjective goes to clarify the noun and the adverb goes to clarify the verb. Okay. So USUAL. As usual I will spend Sunday with my family. As usual I will do some work later. As usual I will cook the dinner. So USUAL with nouns like dinner, work, family. Okay. USUALLY as the adverb as I said goes with the verb. I usually go to work on a metro. I usually do some work in the afternoon. I usually cycle my bike in the mornings.So with the adverb always look for the verb. Usually go, usually do, usually walk, usually work. Okay.
