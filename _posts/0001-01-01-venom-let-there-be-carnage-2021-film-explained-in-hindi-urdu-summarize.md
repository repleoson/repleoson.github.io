The plot is about Eddie and Cletus, whose two alien hosts Symbiotes live in their bodies. Eddie has Venom in his body and frequently converses with him. The lethal protector 'Venom' was a symbiote as well. Cletus Kasady was a killer who preyed on Eddie. Both Venam and Eddie solve many cases for good/by decoding the different images. One night, when Eddie goes to meet Cletus, he bites his hand when extraterrestrial Venom comes out of his body, becoming agitated as a result of the symbiote left in Cletus's body. Eddie is frequently irritated by Venom, Eddie requests that Venom leave and Venom agrees. When Cletus got the death sentence, the symbiote was activated and transformed into Carnage, a massive, frightening, and powerful symbiote. Cletus flees, and Eddie learns that Cletus has escalated. Eddie goes to the orphanage where Cletus used to live, but Cletus ends up at the asylum where he met his partner Frances, whom he adores.
