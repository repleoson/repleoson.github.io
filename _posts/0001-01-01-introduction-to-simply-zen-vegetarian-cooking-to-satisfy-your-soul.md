{% raw %}Kakuho Aoe, a Japanese Buddhist monk and also temple cook, presents you his first recipe book, Simply Zen: Vegetarian Cooking to Satisfy Your Soul.<br /><br />One vital aspect to the Zen sect of Buddhism is monks' adherence to a strictly vegetarian diet. Eating neither meat nor fish, monks also avoid ingredients like garlic, onion, leeks, and chives. As a result, the food prepared in Zen monasteries is healthy, low-calorie, accentuates the most subtle of flavors, and can even be eaten to help detox the body. <br />The recipes contained in Simply Zen  can all be made in three easy steps, leaving cooks with beautiful, healthful dishes that can be enjoyed as a regular meal or presented to guests. <br /><br />For more information you can visit our website and pinterest account below.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://en.d21.co.jp/">http://en.d21.co.jp/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://pinterest.com/discover21inc/">http://pinterest.com/discover21inc/</a><br /><br />Thanks to <br />Time Out Tokyo <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.timeout.jp/en/tokyo">http://www.timeout.jp/en/tokyo</a><br />Khaosan Guesthouse Kabuki <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.khaosan-tokyo.com/ja/kabuki/">http://www.khaosan-tokyo.com/ja/kabuki/</a><br /><br />Photographs by Tomomitsu Masaomi <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/kohgen.jp">http://www.facebook.com/kohgen.jp</a><br />Copyright Free Music from Mus Mus <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://musmus.main.jp/">http://musmus.main.jp/</a><br /><br />Created by Discover 21, Inc.{% endraw %}
