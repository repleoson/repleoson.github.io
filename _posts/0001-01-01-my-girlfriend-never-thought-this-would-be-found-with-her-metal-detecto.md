{% raw %}My Girlfriend Never Thought This Would Be Found With Her Metal Detector!! In this video, my girlfriend and a few of my friends went metal detecting in the woods to find some Civil War relics! What we realized was my girlfriend left her metal detector on top of the hill so when my friends Jake and Jack started metal detecting for treasure they found a ton of three ringer Civil War bullets and a bunch of other treasures found while metal detecting. These had to be my girlfriend's best metal detecting finds and I couldn't believe she found her first three ringers! Be sure to check out my other metal detecting videos for more and thanks so much for watching! #Metaldetecting #Metaldetectorfinds #Treasurehunting<br /><br />‚ö† CHECK OUT OUR NEW WEBSITE!
