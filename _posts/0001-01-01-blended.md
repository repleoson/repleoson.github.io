{% raw %}Reuniting Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore and director Frank Coraci -- the trifecta behind New Line Cinema's game-changing romantic comedy The Wedding Singer -- this modern-day family comedy follows two single parents, Jim and Lauren (Sandler &amp; Barrymore) who, after a disastrous blind date, can agree on only one thing: never to see each other again. They soon find themselves, however Â– with their respective kids from previous marriages -- on the same family vacation package in South Africa. Despite all their efforts to resist, an attraction grows between the two, blending their two families into one...with hilarious results. Brooklyn Nine-Nine's Terry Crews, Community's Joel McHale, Saturday Night Live's Kevin Nealon and Bridesmaids' Wendi McLendon-Covey are also on board to join the fun.{% endraw %}
