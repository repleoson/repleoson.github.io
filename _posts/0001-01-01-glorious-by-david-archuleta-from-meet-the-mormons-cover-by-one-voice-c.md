On Friday, October 31, Masa Fukuda thought it would be fun for the One Voice Children’s Choir to record a cover of David Archuleta’s “Glorious” from the film Meet the Mormons, and submit it for competition. The deadline for submission was Monday, November 3. At 3:00 p.m. on Halloween night, the choir did not even have an arrangement of the song to sing. We started from ground zero. Between 3:00 and 7:00 p.m., Masa created this beautiful arrangement, developed practice tracks and produced sheet music for the students of the choir. That evening, students were challenged to learn the song and come in at 9:00 a.m. the following morning to record the song in the studio. (Remember, this is Halloween night. Most of the kids were out trick-or-treating at this time.) At 3:00 p.m. on October 31, we also did not have a location or a production team to shoot the video. The owners of Millennial Falls were very gracious to let us film the video at their center the next afternoon, but we had to be out by 3:00 p.m. because a wedding was taking place at 4:00 p.m. At 9:00 p.m., October 31, a call went out to Nick Dunn of Ex Machina Films to see if he could arrange to shoot and edit the video the following day. He graciously accepted the challenge. From 9:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m., members of One Voice Children’s Choir came into the studio to record the song while Masa mixed and mastered the recording. At 1:00 p.m., 63 members of the choir began arriving to film while Masa finished mixing in his studio. At 1:30 p.m., he arrived with the final recording and we then taped the entire video and wrapped by 3:00 p.m. Sometimes the pieces just fall into place! A big thanks to all the people who helped to make this video possible, including Jody and Julie at Millennial Falls, Nick Dunn and Jake Dickey of Ex Machina Films, and all the parents and family members of One Voice Children’s Choir who rallied to make this dream a reality in such a short period of time.<br /><br />Sheet music for songs arranged by Masa Fukuda can be purchased at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jwpepper.com/sheet-music/search.jsp?keywords=masa+fukuda">https://www.jwpepper.com/sheet-music/search.jsp?keywords=masa+fukuda</a><br /><br />#ovcc #OneVoiceChildrensChoir #davidarchuletta #glorious #meetthemormons{% endraw %}
