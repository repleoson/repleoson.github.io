{% raw %}I used 1 liter bottles ♥︎ it’s a TOTAL BACK Workout - using water bottles, wine bottles, packs of rice .. or whatever you have at home! / Werbung <br /><br />This was the most requested workout eveeeer! I know it’s super hard to train your back muscles at home, if you don’t have any equipment. But if we get a little creative .. we CAN make it work!  <br /><br />Training your back is super duper important, because everything in our body should be balanced :) people often suffer from back pain when sitting all day long, rounding the back when looking at our phone, etc. - so it’s definitely time to strengthen this part of our body &amp; show it some love (and a beautiful burn haha). <br /><br />_<br /><br />The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing 30s for each exercise. If you need a break - TAKE IT! Don't worry too much about that. <br /><br />I recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles.<br /><br />▸ you can find WORKOUT PLANS with those videos on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations.
