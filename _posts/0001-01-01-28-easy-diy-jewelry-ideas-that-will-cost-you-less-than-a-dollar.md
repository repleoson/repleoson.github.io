{% raw %}AMAZING DIY JEWELRY THAT WILL TAKE YOU LESS THAN 5 MINUTES TO MAKE<br /><br /><br /><br />Why go buy expensive jewelry when you have all the items in your home to make your own. I’m not talking about expensive jewelry equipment, but simple things from around your house that you can turn into cute jewelry. <br /><br />You can add some glue that’s filled with glitter on top of a button and then turn it into an earring. <br /><br />You can also add a jewelry attachment on a vintage’s watch time hand to turn it into a cute pointy earring. <br /><br />Or, you pierce a few holes on some puzzle pieces and then attach them on a long chain to make a beautiful and creative necklace.<br /><br />Speaking of long chains, take some colorful clothing pins, and then attach them on a long chain, then add an earring attachment on the edge and voila. <br /><br />You can also burn the edges of a metal earring attachment and pierce a few Lego pieces to turn them into sturdy earrings. <br /><br />Take an old CD, break it into smaller pieces and then attach it on a piece of lace to turn it into earrings or a necklace. <br /><br /><br /><br />Timestamps:<br /><br />0:07 – Easy DIY jewelry ideas <br /><br />2:10 – Cute jeans bracelet<br /><br />3:59 – Epoxy resin crafts <br /><br />6:02 – Amazing cement earrings<br /><br />8:09 – DIY shell earrings<br /><br />10:08 – Turn paper clips into jewelry<br /><br />12:41 – Creative earring tricks <br /><br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
