{% raw %}Please share this. I don't know about tags or algorithms on YT.  UPDATE: This has yet to go viral and itâ€™s been up here for two hours. Work harder people!<br /><br />2nd update: now accepting click bait viral title suggestions and thumbnails. <br /><br /><br />This is a video I've been making for ages and I've finally finished it so please don't say anything about the audio problems or glitches or anything else because I'm exhausted and so is my dog. <br /><br />It's a deep fake. <br />a deep fake. <br /><br />I had other things to say but I can't remember what they were. <br />Oh! Hey sign up to my mailing list where I'll be announcing live dates soon(ish) and also a special project. I say special but I don't know what that means to you.  You can sign up at www.veitch.me and I think there's a link there or something.{% endraw %}
