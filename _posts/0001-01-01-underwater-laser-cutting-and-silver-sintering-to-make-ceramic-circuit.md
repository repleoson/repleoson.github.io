{% raw %}Thermal stress cracking can be completely avoided by CO2 laser cutting thin alumina sheets underwater.  I also show how to formulate and apply silver paste, then sinter in a kiln to produce double-sided ceramic printed circuit boards with conductive vias.<br /><br />60W CW CO2 laser at 80% power.  10mm/sec.  Standard lens focal length (50mm).  2mm water above ceramic.  180 passes to cut through 0.75mm thick alumina.  <br /><br />Silver paste: 97% silver powder, 3% glass powder by mass.  Particle size 1 micron or less. Add poly vinyl alcohol mold release until desired consistency reached.<br /><br />Paste applied with 4 mil thick vinyl stencil.  Dried in air 10 minutes, then rapidly brought up to 900*C, held for 10 minutes, then rapidly brought back down to room temperature.  Total cycle about 45 minutes.<br /><br />I measured electrical conductivity of the finished traces from my process with vinyl stencils: 4 milliohms per square at 10 micron final thickness.  This is pretty close to the Dupont published spec ( less than 2 milliohm/sq at 16 micron thick)<br /><br />Underwater CO2 laser cutting reference: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/J.JEURCERAMSOC.2011.06.015">https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/J.JEURCERAMSOC.2011.06.015</a><br />60W laser cutter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/294386493292">https://www.ebay.com/itm/294386493292</a><br />Ceramic sheets at McMaster: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mcmaster.com/alumina/nonporous-alumina-ceramic-sheets-and-bars/">https://www.mcmaster.com/alumina/nonporous-alumina-ceramic-sheets-and-bars/</a><br />Ceramic PCB prototypes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ceramic-pcb.com/product/alumina-pcb-al2o3-pcb-prototypes-online/">https://ceramic-pcb.com/product/alumina-pcb-al2o3-pcb-prototypes-online/</a><br />Quickfire kiln: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kruegerpottery.com/products/par_quikfire6">https://kruegerpottery.com/products/par_quikfire6</a><br />Raspberry Pi picoReflow oven controller: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apollo.open-resource.org/mission:resources:picoreflow">https://apollo.open-resource.org/mission:resources:picoreflow</a><br />Silver powder: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/122525930519">https://www.ebay.com/itm/122525930519</a><br />Glass glaze: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0044SCR6O">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0044SCR6O</a><br />Macor: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mcmaster.com/materials/material~glass-mica-ceramic/">https://www.mcmaster.com/materials/material~glass-mica-ceramic/</a><br />Dupont silver paste: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dupont.com/content/dam/dupont/amer/us/en/transportation-industrial/public/documents/en/LF131.pdf">https://www.dupont.com/content/dam/dupont/amer/us/en/transportation-industrial/public/documents/en/LF131.pdf</a><br />Binders for ceramic powder: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://digitalfire.com/article/binders+for+ceramic+bodies">https://digitalfire.com/article/binders+for+ceramic+bodies</a><br />PVA mold release: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tapplastics.com/product/fiberglass/mold_releases/tap_pva_mold_release_liquid/67">https://www.tapplastics.com/product/fiberglass/mold_releases/tap_pva_mold_release_liquid/67</a><br /><br />Applied Science on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/AppliedScience">https://www.patreon.com/AppliedScience</a>{% endraw %}
