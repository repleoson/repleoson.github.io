{% raw %}&quot;How To&quot; video number 32: Backside 180 a.k.a. BS 180, Pineapple Twist<br /><br />This has been one of the most requested how to videos over the last few years. Maybe now you'll see why I put it off for so long... I'm not very good at BS 180s! But I tried my best to give you some insights into how I do this trick and what has helped me figure them out a little better. Hopefully this video will help you get them down a little better and understand some fixes you can make to improve yours.<br /><br />The main things to take away from this are:<br />Swing them shoulders boi!<br />You don't HAVE to pivot but it might help you.<br /><br /><br />P.S. Sorry about the slightly dark lighting, it was super cloudy when I filmed.<br /><br /><br />As always, good luck with this one! You definitely can learn it if you try.<br /><br />Thank you for watching!<br /><br />==================================<br />Business Contact:<br />vlskatechannel@gmail.com<br /><br />Instagram:<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/vlskate/">https://www.instagram.com/vlskate/</a><br /><br />Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/vlskate">https://www.patreon.com/vlskate</a><br /><br />Patreon Thanks:<br />Thank you to Patreon supporters like: Scott Baker.
