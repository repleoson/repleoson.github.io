Pretty crazy that Simply went to Liam's house for videos such as I challenged the 120 Star WR holder to the truest test of skill and Are two Mario 64 speedrunners faster than one? I think Simplyn64 helped Liam Kings speedrun of SM64. Speaking of speedruns, I might do some Super Mario 64 challenge videos soon. Or maybe Clint Stevens or Smallant should come over and then Simply will get SM64 World Record 120 Stars. Anyways, I'm happy for Liam for his 120 star speedrun in sm64 1:38. Who will be the next to get the 120 world record in sm64 120 star wr. Will the next person speedrun mario 64 in 1:37 and get the sm64 120 star world record?{% endraw %}
