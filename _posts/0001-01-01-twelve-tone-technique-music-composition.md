{% raw %}How does serialism work? We look at writing a piece of music using the twelve tone technique, creating a note row, exploring different ways to treat it and explore the fundamentals of the 12 note Serial technique devised and adopted by Schoenberg, Berg and Webern. Schoenberg and his two disciples Berg and Webern are collectively known as The Second Viennese School. When major and minor tonality reached the limits of what it was designed to do at the end of the Romantic Period, one response was Serial Music. Serialism was based on the notion of equality for all twelve semitones of the scale. These were arranged into a row - an order determined by the composer. The row could then be used forwards, backwards, upside down, or upside down and backwards. During this music composition lesson we explain the system, then construct a row and illustrate how the row is used in all these transformations. Fascinating for people who would like to understand the technique, for composers who would like to try writing in this style, and for performers and analysts wanting to grasp the system. We conclude by explaining and performing a piece written in Serial style. <br /><br />ðŸ”´ Subscribe for more videos just like this: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />ðŸŽµ Become a Music Matters Maestro: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join</a><br /><br />ðŸ•˜ Timestamps<br />0:00 - Introduction to twelve tone technique<br />2:41 - Creating a note row<br />5:54 - Transformations of the row<br />7:40 - A piece of music using the note row<br /><br />ðŸŽ“ Learn Music Online with Music Matters<br />Learn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!
