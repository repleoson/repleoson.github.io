Lyrics:<br /><br />[Hook] <br /><br />Talk to me nice or don’t talk to me twice I been in my bag Paranoia, I got PTSD 30 in my mag <br />I came from rags to riches ain’t tryna go back to the rags  <br />And my new lil’ bitch been trippin’, I ain’t really tryna be no dad I thought you seen it in me I’ma star <br />Won’t switch the wrap a nigga switch the car <br />I left the earth and ended up on Mars <br />That mean I’m sitting next to the stars <br />I thought you seen it on me I got scars <br />Rather be judged by twelve than be carried by six <br />But I still won’t see no bars <br />I never knew tears was what it cost <br /><br />[Verse 1] <br /><br />I got a bad bitch but don’t need her <br />I got a bad bitch but’ll leave her <br />I hung with bakers like Anita <br />And I had some bad dreams bout the reaper <br />I just rock Off-White not Adidas <br />I just might Off-White my tuxedo <br />These niggas act Danny DeVito <br />I know she a freak bitch want to speedo Won’t give her none I’m tryna run up them dividends <br />She lost her mind if she think I’m gon give her some Say she a fish in the pond I’ma bigger one <br />It don’t take shit to go get a gun <br />I made it out I was just with the lil’ ones <br />How you a activists and you ain’t did enough <br />Pray to God bout my life then I live it up <br /><br /> <br /><br />[Hook] <br /><br />Talk to me nice or don’t talk to me twice I been in my bag Paranoia,<br />I got PTSD 30 in my mag <br />I came from rags to riches ain’t tryna go back to the rags  <br />And my new lil’ bitch been trippin’, I ain’t really tryna be no dad I thought you seen it in me<br />I’ma star <br />Won’t switch the wrap a nigga switch the car <br />I left the earth and ended up on Mars <br />That mean I’m sitting next to the stars <br />I thought you seen it on me I got scars <br />Rather be judged by twelve than be carried by six <br />But I still won’t see no bars <br />I never knew tears was what it cost <br /><br />[Verse 2] <br /><br />I hit it one time uno cut it <br />Switch bitches like switchin’ whips, nigga fuck it <br />See me with another bitch I’m up to something <br />See you wit the opps we catch you and get to dumping <br />He in the past <br />I put lil bro and nem on his ass <br />Cartier thought this would be my last <br />Took a year ran it up and I did it fast <br />I put the losses wit the wins <br />Introduced bosses to my friends <br />Introduced friends to the bosses so we all can be bosses at the end Took the bitch from aseven turnt her to a ten <br />Now the bitch want a Big Baby, no Glen <br />I knew the world was fucked <br />I fucked a stripper bitch I seen the condom pop and then she grinned Damn <br /><br />[Hook] <br /><br />Talk to me nice or don’t talk to me twice I been in my bag Paranoia, I got PTSD 30 in my mag <br />I came from rags to riches ain’t tryna go back to the rags  <br />And my new lil’ bitch been trippin’, I ain’t really tryna be no dad I thought you seen it in me I’ma star <br />Won’t switch the wrap a nigga switch the car <br />I left the earth and ended up on Mars <br />That mean I’m sitting next to the stars <br />I thought you seen it on me I got scars <br />Rather be judged by twelve than be carried by six <br />But I still won’t see no bars <br />I never knew tears was what it cost<br /><br />#Toosii #WhatItCost #ThankYouForBelieving{% endraw %}
