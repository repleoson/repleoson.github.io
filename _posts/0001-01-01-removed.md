Without her partnership, this would not have happened, and definitely would not have been such a fun process. We were inspired to create this film while in foster parent training.<br /><br />And then of course Tony Cruz. I asked him early on if he'd be willing to tackle this with me. I wasn't sure if I was really going to pursue it unless he said yes. He graciously agreed and was, to me, a huge source of confidence in knowing this project would turn out well. He and i discussed everything during the pre-production, and i counted on his creative mind to keep me on the right path. He even persuaded another key creative on the project, Greg Pickard, to join us. On Set Tony was my right hand man. On set, if I just wasn't feeling it, I had the trust in him to be able to just hand the scene off to him and know he would make it work. And he stepped in plenty of times when i just needed a break, or a separate perspective. Some of the best moments in the film are of his doing. Go check him out at tonycruz.co<br /><br />We were very fortunate with Abby White, the young actress. Without her we wouldn't have a film. <br /><br />Her parents were so amazing as well. I don't think they anticipated how much involvement it would take on their end, but they stuck with it the whole way. Abby's dad, Andy White from Good Times Guitar, even recorded Abby's Voice Over for us in his studio.<br /><br />We also owe a huge thanks to our cast: Sabrina Culver, the birth mom, who brought so much to her role <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0191747/">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0191747/</a> and also Jordan Nice, who gave a phenomenal performance as the abusive boyfriend: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2059038/">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2059038/</a> . Last but certainly not least, Kyra Locke, who played the committed caring foster mom, who truly brought such an amazing contribution to the story: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2753903/">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2753903/</a><br />We can vouch for each of them. They are worth working with!<br /><br />Color grading: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sendowl.com?r=3c882">https://www.sendowl.com?r=3c882</a>{% endraw %}
