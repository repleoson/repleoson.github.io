{% raw %}Y'all have asked for it, and here it is. Today I'll be giving you a tour of my Notion setup, which I use to organize, plan, and execute every stage of my video production process.<br /><br />Find all my Notion tutorials and templates: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thomasjfrank.com/notion/">https://thomasjfrank.com/notion/</a><br /><br />Sign up for an annual CuriosityStream subscription and you'll also get a free Nebula subscription (the new streaming platform built by creators) here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://curiositystream.com/thomas">http://curiositystream.com/thomas</a><br /><br />Huge thanks to CuriosityStream for sponsoring this video and supporting my channel!<br /><br />It's no exaggeration to say that Notion has become the most powerful productivity app in my stack of tools. While I use other apps for taking notes and tracking tasks, Notion allows me to manage projects in a way that no other app offers.<br /><br />In this Notion tour, I'll show you exactly how I use it to manage my production process. Along the way, you'll see how to use and combine three features that many people don't know about - databases, templates, and relations/roll-ups. Whether you're a student, a professional, or a content creator, I think you'll find some inspiration here!<br /><br />Here's a public version of my video tracker template that you can duplicate and use:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thomasjfrank.com/templates/notion-video-project-tracker/">https://thomasjfrank.com/templates/notion-video-project-tracker/</a><br /><br />Some more Notion videos:<br /><br />- Ali Abdaal's Notion video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODl5FOMu8kI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODl5FOMu8kI</a><br />- Keep Productive's most recent setup: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtBSAwPSjoU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtBSAwPSjoU</a><br />- Mariana's Notion video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GCpF-4N2tc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GCpF-4N2tc</a><br /><br />----<br />#productivity #notion<br />----<br /><br />üìóGet my book &quot;10 Steps to Earning Awesome Grades&quot; FREE: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/get-better-grades/">https://collegeinfogeek.com/get-better-grades/</a><br /><br />üê¶Follow Me:<br />Instagram ‚ûî <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/tomfrankly">https://instagram.com/tomfrankly</a><br />Twitter ‚ûî <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/tomfrankly">https://twitter.com/tomfrankly</a><br />Podcast ‚ûî <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/TheCollegeInfoGeekPodcast">https://www.youtube.com/TheCollegeInfoGeekPodcast</a><br />Spotify Study Playlist ‚ûî <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/thomasfrank09/playlist/4ETfiRPHVmUFLF6q0g8Fux?si=IPfx3dAgQ1SIUwhh5YEQMQ">https://open.spotify.com/user/thomasfrank09/playlist/4ETfiRPHVmUFLF6q0g8Fux?si=IPfx3dAgQ1SIUwhh5YEQMQ</a><br /><br />üì°Subscribe to My Channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://buff.ly/1vQP5ar">http://buff.ly/1vQP5ar</a><br /><br />üé•My Video Gear:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/thomasfrank">https://www.amazon.com/shop/thomasfrank</a><br /><br />üéßBackground music via Musicbed.
