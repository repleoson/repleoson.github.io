{% raw %}None of us like difficulties. If we had a choice, we probably wouldn’t go through them. But our past challenges have a purpose—they prepare us for our future!<br /><br />Discover the importance of remembering God’s faithfulness in your life and see how this will enrich your faith. Psalm 34:2-3 says, “Let all who are discouraged take heart. Come, let us talk about God’s goodness.”<br /><br />When you’re always thinking about God’s goodness—how He’s promoted you, vindicated you and protected you—not only will faith rise in your heart, but that attitude of expectancy is what allows God to work in greater ways in your life!<br /><br />Do you feel left out or overlooked by others? Have you let this keep you from moving forward in life? Joel wants to teach you a very important life lesson—you don’t need others approval and belief—you have Almighty God’s approval, and He believes in you. God has the final say. Promotion doesn’t come from people, it comes from the Lord. People may bypass you, discount you or not give you the time of day, but they cannot stop what God has ordained for you. <br /><br />This is Message #673 “Just Remember“ by Joel Osteen.
