{% raw %}In this video we will be taking a look at a flat roof repair that will cover large areas, or the whole roof if you need it to. This repair uses a solvent based bitumen sealant, the advantage being that it's low cost, dries quickly, and is waterproof fast.<br /><br />If you think you need a new flat roof you can check out some of the options here : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.fixmyroof.co.uk/videos-and-guides/flat-roof-replacement/">http://www.fixmyroof.co.uk/videos-and-guides/flat-roof-replacement/</a><br /><br />For links to the types of materials I used in this project see here : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.fixmyroof.co.uk/flat-roof-repair/bitumen-roof-paint/">http://www.fixmyroof.co.uk/flat-roof-repair/bitumen-roof-paint/</a> <br /><br />To subscribe click here : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/123fixmyroof?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/123fixmyroof?sub_confirmation=1</a>{% endraw %}
