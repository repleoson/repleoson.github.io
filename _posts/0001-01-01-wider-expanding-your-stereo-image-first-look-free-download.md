{% raw %}► Download Wider : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.adsrsounds.com/product/software/wider/">https://www.adsrsounds.com/product/software/wider/</a><br /><br />In this video we look at Wider, the new free plug-in from Infected Mushroom &amp; Polyverse.<br /><br />Widen Your Sound Today – For Free!<br /><br />Wider takes the massively popular stereo section from its sibling, Manipulator, and gives you the ability to expand the stereo image of any signal to an awe-inspiring amount of width.<br /><br />However, Wider is a unique stereo plugin in the sense that it is completely “mono-compatible”, meaning that any signal that has been extended will always remain in phase with itself, even if summed to mono.<br /><br />BROADEN YOUR HORIZONS<br /><br />Many stereo effects currently in use have the nasty habit of knocking signals out of phase, which can quickly make mixes sound muddy and unbalanced, or make sounds seem flat and lacking dynamics if one isn’t mindful of the effect.<br /><br />Thanks to Wider’s one-of-a-kind all pass and comb filtering algorithm, no phase in any mix or affected audio will be compromised, even at its broadest setting! Instead, Wider cancels itself out when summed to mono, so the original signal is left intact: a feature you won’t find in any other stereo plugin.<br /><br />Wider can be used to increase the stereo image of any signal up to 200% of full stereo for an extra wide, exaggerated effect.<br /><br />EXTRAORDINARY SPACE, PROFESSIONAL CLARITY<br /><br />No matter how far out and experimental Infected Mushroom’s sounds get, they always keep their mixes clean, crisp, and translatable without sacrificing power. Now you can achieve the same depth and clarity, absolutely free.<br /><br />Like, favourite and subscribe to support ADSR.<br /><br />-- ADSR --<br /><br />Facebook : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ADSRSounds">https://www.facebook.com/ADSRSounds</a><br />Presets, Samples &amp; Loops : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.adsrsounds.com">http://www.adsrsounds.com</a>{% endraw %}
