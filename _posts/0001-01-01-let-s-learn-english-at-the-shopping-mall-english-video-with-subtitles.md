Bob the Canadian here.  Let’s learn English….<br /><br />Well that’s not very nice!<br /><br />Let’s learn English at the shopping mall.  Hey welcome to this video.  If this is your first time here don’t forget to click the subscribe button below.  And if you don’t mind at some point during this video give me a thumbs up.  Let’s head into the mall.<br /><br />So one of the first things I like to look for when I walk into the entrance of a mall is the map and the list of stores.  If you look down here it will list all of the stores that are in the mall, and you can find the particular store that you’re looking for with it’s number.  So for instance if I wanted to go to Shoppers Drug Mart.  It’s store number 8.  I can then look at the map and find store number 8.  There should also be a “You Are Here.” type of thing.  Why can’t I find it?  Oh it’s over here.  It’s a little hard for me sometimes to think quickly.  But, “You are Here” so I know that I came in this entranceway and I’m standing right here right now.<br /><br />So I should say though that often I’ll just refer to the shopping mall as a mall.  In English we often have short forms for different words.  We don’t often actually say the word, “shopping mall”.  We usually just say mall.  I’m going to the mall.  I’m going to get some things at the mall.<br /><br />And there’s a couple different kinds of stores at the mall.  If you look behind me there’s a traditional type of store, but if you look right here there’s something that we would call a “kiosk”.  This particular kiosk looks like it sells cell phones.<br /><br />Probably the store that you’ll find the most often at the mall is a clothing store.  I think in this mall almost probably ¾ of the stores are actually clothing stores.<br /><br />Other types of stores are things like, behind me over here there’s a card store, and over here there is a game store, a video game store, and if you look way, oh, there’s another clothing store, and if you look way down there, there’s a cell phone store.  So those are some of the typical types of stores that you’ll find at a mall.<br /><br />This is where my kids always wanna stop when we’re at the mall.  But I always say no.  Am I a mean dad?  And they always wanna stop here too and I say no again.<br /><br />So behind me here you’ll see a shoe store.  There’s usually two or three shoe stores in a mall.  I don’t buy shoes very often so it’s not a store that I go into a lot.  But let’s walk for a bit and I’ll show you what my favourite store is.<br /><br />So behind me is my favourite store, which a bookstore.  I love to read books.  I think maybe we should go inside and see if they have a good book to help people learn English.  I don’t know if they do, but I’m just gonna walk in and ask them, so let’s go.<br /><br /><br />**Note:  All images used under:<br /> CC0 License ✓ Free for personal and commercial use ✓ No attribution required<br />From pexels.com or pixabay.com{% endraw %}
