{% raw %}Introducing the NEW Gibson Generation Collection, Gibson's most affordable acoustic guitars! Based on classic Gibson models, such as the J-45, or the J-200, these new acoustics are American made &amp; considerably more affordable! | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/yjp3p2ua">https://tinyurl.com/yjp3p2ua</a><br /><br />» Gibson Generation Collection G-00 Acoustic | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/yhqbmem2">https://tinyurl.com/yhqbmem2</a><br />» Gibson Generation Collection G-45 Acoustic | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/yeq5drwt">https://tinyurl.com/yeq5drwt</a><br />» Gibson Generation Collection G-Writer EC Electro Acoustic | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/ydnejyko">https://tinyurl.com/ydnejyko</a><br />» Gibson Generation Collection G-200 EC Electro Acoustic | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/ygzpqd2e">https://tinyurl.com/ygzpqd2e</a><br /><br />The Gibson Generations Collection sits between £899 &amp; £1799 depending on the model. We're not saying that's cheap but all of them have a solid spruce top, solid walnut back &amp; sides, mahogany neck and an ebony fingerboard. The G-Writer and G-200 also have pickups! Now that's already a lot of guitar, but that's not it... They're also made in America in the same factory as the core models. The Generation Series also features Player Ports, an extra sound hole on the side of the guitar for even more immersion! <br /><br />🎥  Looking to watch something else?
