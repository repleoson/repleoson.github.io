It is a trajectory.” [5:04]<br /><br />“If you are a little sensitive to life you will realize you’re the biggest issue in your life.” [7:12]<br /><br />“If you have the fear of falling down and suffering you will not go very high. [11:45]<br /><br />“The privileges of the nature of your experience must be in your hand.” [12:43]<br /><br />“A child is not a legacy. It’s a life. And it’s an individual life. It has to be what it has to be.” [15:37]<br /><br />“Death is a closure. Life is a possibility.” [26:36]<br /><br />“Your experience is entirely determined by you.” [29:15]<br /><br />“Only when your attention and involvement is indiscriminate does the universe open up to you.” [31:30]<br /><br />“The content of our life will not change our life. It is the context of our life which changes our life.” [43:55]<br /><br />“This, this is a living cosmos. Everybody's free to capture as much as they want. If you capture a substantial amount of life, your very presence will become a significant life. Otherwise, you will become a mediocre life. This is the important thing. It's not the knowledge you gather in your head. It's not the muscle that you gather in your body. It's the life.” [44:45]<br /><br />FOLLOW SADHGURU:<br />WEBSITE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2HuY6mX">https://bit.ly/2HuY6mX</a><br />FACEBOOK - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/28LgANv">https://bit.ly/28LgANv</a><br />TWITTER - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/1JoTe0I">https://bit.ly/1JoTe0I</a><br />INSTAGRAM - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2VaF3UO">https://bit.ly/2VaF3UO</a><br />YOUTUBE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2m9Djvb">https://bit.ly/2m9Djvb</a><br /><br />BOOKS MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE:<br />Inner Engineering: A Yogi’s Guide to Joy - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2OhBopr">https://amzn.to/2OhBopr</a> [1:58]<br />Adiyogi: The Source of Yoga - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3sVYIYX">https://amzn.to/3sVYIYX</a> [2:02]<br /><br />ORGANIZATIONS MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE:<br />Isha Foundation - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2JpyZWL">https://bit.ly/2JpyZWL</a> [1:40]<br /><br />IMPACT THEORY MERCHANDISE:<br />Check out Impact Theory's Merch Shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/ImpactTheoryShop">http://bit.ly/ImpactTheoryShop</a>{% endraw %}
