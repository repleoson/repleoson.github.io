{% raw %}This event was made to remember Roblox's major outage a week ago. It's a pretty difficult event map too with many flame enemies and unique mechanics. It's not as hard as The Black Ordeal, but it was still challenging and fun to complete! The boss probably references the main cause of Roblox's outage. He is very similar to Ignitus from Tower Blitz in lots of ways! Anyways, thanks to Leeelooo, Grand, and Cosmo for helping me beat this event and complete everything in the game so far. Sadly, CTD is on hiatus too, so there probably won't be any good videos on this for a while. I hope you enjoy the video though!<br /><br />My Discord Server: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/EAtxH7a">https://discord.gg/EAtxH7a</a><br /><br />0:00 Intro/Start<br />0:22 Wave 0<br />1:50 Waves 1 - 3<br />4:03 Wave 4 (Flame Caster)<br />5:29 Waves 5 - 7 (Ignis Wights)<br />9:09 Waves 8 - 10 (Ignis Bladers)<br />12:47 Waves 11 - 12 (Flameshield)<br />15:41 Wave 13 (The Ember Originator)<br />19:41 Triumph/Outro{% endraw %}
