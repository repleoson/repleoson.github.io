{% raw %}Hunt Saboteurs Association News Release 31st October 2017<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />On Saturday the 28th October the Surrey Union Hunt held their opening meet at Gosterwood Manor Farm, Ockley near Dorking. As well as approx 100 hunt riders there were also 20 hunt saboteurs and 20 Surrey police officers present. The police spent the entire day following sabs around and were completely disinterested in what the hunt were up to.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />In the middle of the afternoon the hunts hounds, who were supposedly following an artificial trail, rioted into a private garden, terrorising some semi-tame deer and a domestic cat. Members of the hunt then trespassed into the garden to retrieve the hounds. The householders were furious about the hunt incursion onto their property and came out to remonstrate with members of the hunt. Officers from Surrey police stood idly by and did nothing to help whilst this was going on.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Lee Moon, Spokesperson for the Hunt Saboteurs Association, stated: “The Surrey Union claim to follow artificial trails. If this was the case what were they doing with their hounds in a private garden terrorising a family's pet. It's a shame that Surrey police don't spend more time policing the real countryside terrorists rather than the hunt sabs who are doing their job for them. Well done to these brave landowners for standing up to the hunt. We're sure there are many more who don't want the hunt on their land but are too scared to say anything.”{% endraw %}
