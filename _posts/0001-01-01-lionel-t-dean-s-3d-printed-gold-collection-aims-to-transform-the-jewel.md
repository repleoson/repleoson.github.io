{% raw %}Digital manufacturing could &quot;reshape the jewellery industry,&quot; says designer Lionel T Dean, who has created a collection that is 3D printed in 18 carat gold.<br /><br />Dean designed the pieces as part of a project called Precious, a collaboration between five companies including software provider Delcam and precious metal supplier Cooksongold, which is aiming to modernise the UK jewellery industry.<br /><br />The first range, which includes items by Dean and other designers, was unveiled in August at Birmingham City University's School of Jewellery.<br /><br />&quot;We're here today to launch our collection of 3D-printed gold artefacts to demonstrate to the UK jewellery industry the potential of 3D printing,&quot; Dean explains in the movie. &quot;Additive manufacturing with metal allows you to create forms that would be almost impossible to create by conventional means.&quot;<br /><br />While the jewellery industry has used 3D printing to create moulds for a long time, Dean says it has been much slower to take up printing directly with metal.<br /><br />&quot;The jewellery industry was one of the early adopters of additive technology, using it in an indirect sense,&quot; he says. &quot;So printing waxes and casting from those waxes. It's been more reluctant to adopt direct metal processes.&quot;<br /><br />One of the reasons for this is the high value of the raw materials. Initially, Dean tried using a regular laser-sintering machine to produce his jewellery, but the wastage was too high. Cooksongold provided a laser-sintering machine called the Precious M080, which it developed together with 3D printer manufacturer EOS specifically for use with precious metals.<br /><br />Read more on Dezeen: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dezeen.com/?p=762340">http://www.dezeen.com/?p=762340</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Dezeen's YouTube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/dezeenmagazine?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/user/dezeenmagazine?sub_confirmation=1</a>{% endraw %}
