{% raw %}It's a nightmare scenario: you head over to your local supermarket for groceries, but you walk right into a mass shooting and have to run for your life. That happened to people at a Kroger in Collierville, Tennessee. Terrified staff and customers hid in the walk-in freezers. One employee fled to the roof, raising his hands high to make it clear to cops that he was not the shooter. Earlier this year 10 people were killed when a man opened fire at a Kroger-owned grocery store in Colorado.{% endraw %}
