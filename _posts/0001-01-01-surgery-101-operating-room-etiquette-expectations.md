{% raw %}Have you ever wondered what it's like to be in the operating room, elbow to elbow with surgeons, using the latest in cutting edge surgical technology to save lives? You've seen it on TV shows, but perhaps never stepped in the OR yourself. It seems mysterious, intense, even a little intimidating. Here's what to expect when you first enter the operating room.<br /><br />These are the 4 things you should know before you first step foot in the operating room:<br /><br />1. Understand operating room etiquette, meaning you should always introduce yourself and write your name on the white board. Do your best to not get in the way of the surgeon and other members of the surgical team, don't be on your phone, and try to be helpful wherever possible. <br /><br />2. Do not contaminate the sterile field! The sterile field is what reduces the risk of infection and complication for the patient, and compromising this will negatively impact patient safety. <br /><br />3. Be prepared for your level in training. As a third year medical student, you will have different expectations of what you should know and what you'll be doing compared to a fourth year medical student or even a junior resident. You should be practicing suturing and knot tying at home in order to be proficient while in surgery.<br /><br />4. Be helpful in the operating room. As you get more exposure to surgery, you'll understand the flow of things and more readily be able to lend a helping hand in transferring the patient, securing surgical supplies, or even prepare imaging on the monitor for the surgeon.<br /><br />üíå Sign up for my weekly newsletter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://medschoolinsiders.com/newsletter">https://medschoolinsiders.com/newsletter</a><br />üåç Website &amp; blog - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://medschoolinsiders.com">https://medschoolinsiders.com</a><br /><br />üì∏ Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/medschoolinsiders">https://instagram.com/medschoolinsiders</a><br />üê¶ Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/medinsiders">https://twitter.com/medinsiders</a><br />üó£Ô∏è Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/medschoolinsiders">https://facebook.com/medschoolinsiders</a><br /><br />üé• My Youtube Gear: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kit.co/kevinjubbalmd/">https://kit.co/kevinjubbalmd/</a><br />üëÄ Hand Picked Productivity Tools: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/medschoolinsiders">https://www.amazon.com/shop/medschoolinsiders</a><br />üéµMy Study Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1231934998/playlist/5joGbr1aQAIbMcJ9bOvJlk?si=iOAxgKNTQt-rrp1L8g-YWQ">https://open.spotify.com/user/1231934998/playlist/5joGbr1aQAIbMcJ9bOvJlk?si=iOAxgKNTQt-rrp1L8g-YWQ</a><br /><br />TIME STAMPS:<br />00:00 Introduction<br />00:27 Understand Operating Room Etiquette<br />02:27 The Holy Sterile Field<br />04:31 Be Prepared<br />06:15 Be Helpful<br /><br />LINKS FROM VIDEO:<br />Meet the Members of the Surgical Team: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/-6cH9ifIm-A">https://youtu.be/-6cH9ifIm-A</a><br />So You Want to Be a Surgeon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/nKP1v_ZXkbg">https://youtu.be/nKP1v_ZXkbg</a><br /><br />#medicalschool #surgery #premed<br />====================<br /><br />Disclaimer: Content of this video is my opinion and does not constitute medical advice.
