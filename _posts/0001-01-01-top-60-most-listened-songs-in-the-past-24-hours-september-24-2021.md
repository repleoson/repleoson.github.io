{% raw %}Top 60 Most Listened Songs In The Past 24 hours - SEPTEMBER 2021!<br /><br />These are without a doubt the most popular tracks in the previous 24 hours; what I appreciate best is that people have begun to listen to older songs again; this makes me so glad because today's music has become so corrupted ,Maybe some new songs are good, but they are not popular! what i want to say about some songs during this year sound the same, and it makes me think that the songs during the last years have not been good both in the Lyric and in the video clip!<br /><br />Spotify : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/3zSkkc1">https://spoti.fi/3zSkkc1</a><br /><br />No copyright infringement intended.
