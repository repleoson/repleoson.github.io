{% raw %}The Fungus in Resident Evil 7 is one that doesnt so much invade your cells and completely take them over, but instead stimulates natural responses to heal wounds. In the process however, the one who controls this fungal tissue can overtake the minds of a person, bending them to their will. In this episode, we will discuss how this is possible!<br /><br />Thank you for watching Roanoke Gaming and I hope you enjoy The B.O.W.
