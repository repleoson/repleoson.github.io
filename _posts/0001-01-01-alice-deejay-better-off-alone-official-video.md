Alice Deejay’s album 'Who Needs Guitars Anyway?' featured no less than 5 international hits, sold over 1 million albums and 5 million singles and crushed the charts in Germany, France, South Africa, Australia, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and Canada - just to name a few. Back in the 90s, you could hear lead singles Better Off Alone, Will I Ever and Back In My Life riding the airwaves non-stop. <br /><br />Not to mention the influence Alice Deejay has had on dance music; many great artists such as David Guetta and Akon, Whiz Khalifa and now Puerto Rican megastar Farruko, scored hits using the hook of ‘Better Off Alone’.<br /><br />The music video was shot in Miami and features Alice DJ - Judith Pronk, MIla and Angelique - in the iconic colourful setting. The video was partially directed by Cousin Mike with the 1711 Production Group. The video also consists of desert scenes from the original video dubbed UK edit, directed by Olaf van Gerwen with Blood Simple. <br /><br />Check out the UK edit video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHjNmyzrVvM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHjNmyzrVvM</a><br /><br />Lyrics: Better Off Alone<br /><br />Do you think you're better off alone<br />Do you think you're better off alone<br />Do you think you're better off alone<br />Do you think you're better off alone<br /><br />Talk to me <br />Ooooooh talk to me <br />Talk to me <br />Ooooooh talk to me<br /><br />Do you think you're better off alone<br />Do you think you're better off alone<br /><br />Do you think you're better off alone<br />Do you think you're better off alone<br />Do you think you're better off alone<br />Do you think you're better off alone<br /><br />Talk to me <br />Ooooooh talk to me <br />Talk to me <br />Ooooooh talk to me<br />Talk to me<br /><br />Talk to me{% endraw %}
