{% raw %}Boredom makes you more creative, altruistic, introspective, and helps with autobiographical planning.<br />This video was sponsored by LastPass: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2wAsdUu">http://bit.ly/2wAsdUu</a><br /><br />I feel like this video might come across as condescending but the person I'm really talking to is myself. Despite the fact that I know how useful it can be to be bored, I still find myself trying to fill every last moment with stimulus. Boredom is unpleasant - the open, unstructured thinking that can take place can also feel pointless. But now I'm made this video to remind myself how important boredom is so hopefully I'll make more time to be bored.<br /><br />More resources:<br /><br />The boredom leads people to shock themselves study:<br />Just Think: The challenges of the disengaged mind<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/WILSON%20ET%20AL%202014.pdf">https://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/WILSON%20ET%20AL%202014.pdf</a><br /><br />Boredom leads people to consider their future and set goals study:<br />Back to the future: Autobiographical planning and the functionality of mind-wandering<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810011001978">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810011001978</a><br /><br />On boredom and altruism:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ca72/0f959d3c9c31187ac30b28ecfec430bc98cc.pdf">https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ca72/0f959d3c9c31187ac30b28ecfec430bc98cc.pdf</a><br /><br />Does boredom make us more creative?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10400419.2014.901073">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10400419.2014.901073</a><br /><br />Amazing filming by Raquel Nuno<br /><br />Music from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://epidemicsound.com">http://epidemicsound.com</a> &quot;I Think I Was There&quot; &quot;Critical Thinking 2&quot; &quot;Wide Open&quot; &quot;Seaweed&quot; &quot;A Sound Foundation 1&quot;<br /><br />Music also by Kevin MacLeod <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com">http://incompetech.com</a> &quot;Fig Leaf Rag&quot;{% endraw %}
