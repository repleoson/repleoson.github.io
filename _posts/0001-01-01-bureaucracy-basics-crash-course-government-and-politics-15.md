{% raw %}This week Craig Benzine discuses bureaucracies. Bureaucracies tend to be associated with unintelligible rules and time-wasting procedures, but they play an important, though controversial, role in governing. From the FDA to the EPA, these agencies were established to help the government manage and carry out laws much more efficiently - to bring the rule making and enforcement closer to the experts. But the federal bureaucracy (which is part of the executive branch) has a lot of power and sometimes acts likes Congress in creating regulations and like the courts through administrative adjudications. It's all a bit problematic for that whole &quot;separation of powers&quot; thing. So we'll talk about that too, and the arguments for and against increased federal bureaucracy. <br /><br />Support is provided by Voqal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.voqal.org">http://www.voqal.org</a><br />--<br /><br />Want to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?<br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse">http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse">http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse</a><br />Tumblr - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com">http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com</a> <br />Support Crash Course on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/crashcourse">http://patreon.com/crashcourse</a><br /><br />CC Kids: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids">http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids</a>{% endraw %}
