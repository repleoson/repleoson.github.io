{% raw %}Thank you for watching! I made this video for my 8th grade class. The purpose of the video was to show at the very beginning of the North America unit and to pause the video after each region is shown to discuss as a class the physical characteristics they noticed about each. <br /><br />I've also attached a free 5 question worksheet on teacher pay teachers that I used during COVID-19 virtual learning. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/North-America-Geographic-Regions-Youtube-Video-Worksheet-5973144#show-price-update">https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/North-America-Geographic-Regions-Youtube-Video-Worksheet-5973144#show-price-update</a><br /><br />Please follow me <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/zackfleming">http://twitter.com/zackfleming</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/geographygeek_">http://instagram.com/geographygeek_</a>{% endraw %}
