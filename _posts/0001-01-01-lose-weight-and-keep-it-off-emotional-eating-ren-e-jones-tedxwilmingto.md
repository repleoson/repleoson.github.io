{% raw %}Most diets, detoxes, or pills promise overnight and effortless weight loss, but it never lasts, and 'yo-yo dieting' leads to greater and more demoralizing weight gain.  We typically follow the diet until something drives us to the refrigerator for comfort or stress relief.  Renée Jones shows you how to get free from the emotional eating that sabotages every diet.<br /> -<br />After 40 years on a diet, yo-yoing up and down the scale, Renée Jones had learned every diet – and every cheat – before finally stopping the comfort eating and self-sabotage to lose “those last 30 pounds” AGAIN in 2012 – but this time she maintained her goal weight.  Who knew that was truly possible?<br /> <br />With a Master’s degree in Marriage and Family Counseling and a Clinical Residency in Pastoral Care, she has an international counseling and coaching practice utilizing traditional and contemporary models as well as relaxation and horse-assisted methods to help others win at losing extra weight and other baggage they’ve dragged with them for decades.  <br /><br />Her first book was &quot;What’s Really Eating You: Overcome the Triggers of Comfort Eating.&quot; This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
