{% raw %}🎬💖Please share this video with your friends!💖🎬<br /><br />I'd love to answer all of your questions, but it’s difficult to get to all of them. Below are some of the most common questions I get from learners like you!<br /><br />⭐What's your name and where are you from?⭐<br /><br />My name is Sarah and I'm from the United States. I was born and raised in the state of Wisconsin, but I now live in Colorado.<br /><br />⭐Have you ever lived abroad?⭐<br /><br />Yes, I've spent time living in Italy, Costa Rica, Portugal, and South Korea. <br /><br />⭐What languages do you speak?⭐<br /><br />I've studied Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and Korean, but I don't yet speak any of them fluently. I know common phrases and expressions to help me get around, but I still have a lot to learn. <br /><br />⭐Are you a qualified English teacher?⭐<br /><br />Yes! I have my M.A. in TESOL from The University of Wisconsin, River Falls. I’ve been teaching English language learners for the past 7 years and online for the past 4 years.<br /><br />⭐Do you teach private lessons?⭐<br /><br />Yes, I do! You can book a 1:1 lesson with me here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sarahsenglishclub.com/11-lessons/">https://sarahsenglishclub.com/11-lessons/</a> or send me an email if you have any questions at sarahsenglishclub@gmail.com <br /><br />⭐Can I get free lessons or a discount on your private lessons?⭐<br /><br />I wish there were 10 of me, so I could give everyone free lessons!! But, I have to pay my bills and make a living, so the answer is no. I do create free weekly lesson here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sarahsenglishclub.com/student-qa/">https://sarahsenglishclub.com/student-qa/</a> and I also give away a FREE eBook when you sign up for my mailing list.
