I use a lot of stock footage (both paid for and free) clips of videos that I can find related to the video and search for images to visualize the story that we are trying to tell. I hire different researchers and writers for the script, along with our original commentary. Most importantly we find the best vlog background music, usually royalty free from Incompetech or epidemic sounds to create an exciting atmosphere while watching our videos.{% endraw %}
