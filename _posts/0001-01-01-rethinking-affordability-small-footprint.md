{% raw %}Small footprint design presents an opportunity to radically change our approach to affordable housing. Not only on the scale of individual apartments but also in the planning of our city blocks and existing buildings.  Throughout these areas, Rob McGauran see’s large amounts of ‘lazy land’, space that could easily be occupied by uniquely designed affordable housing that brings those in need into our communities, rather than moving them into high rise towers. In Amsterdam, Heren 5 has designed a unique neighbourhood of housing units, featuring tailored apartments fit for different stages of life. In a post-COVID world, with housing becoming less affordable in many places, these projects are designed to bring a diverse range of people together in areas that they may have been unable to access, and build new communities as the way we live changes.<br /><br />0:00 - Intro with Rob McGauran and Colin<br />1:02 - Paty Rios of Happy City<br />1:34 - Designing small footprint social housing on empty land<br />5:00 - What is social housing like?<br />5:55 - How do we build better affordable housing<br />7:10 - Social housing in Amsterdam<br />10:53 - Outro with Colin<br /><br />Supported by Screen Australia &amp; Youtube through the Skip Ahead Initiative<br /><br />Produced by New Mac Video Agency<br />Directed &amp; Presented by: Colin Chee<br />Producer: Luke Clark<br />Cinematographer: Simon Davies<br />Editor: Jessica Ruasol<br /><br />Music: <br />Tomorrow by ANBR<br />Anima by Enzalla<br />Voyager by Marshall Usinger<br />Bombus by REW<br />Devotion by Dear Gravity<br />Coriolis by REW<br />Whose Mark Is the Hare by REW{% endraw %}
