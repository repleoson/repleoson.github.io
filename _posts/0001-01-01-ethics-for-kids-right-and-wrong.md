{% raw %}Melfyn the Magic Scout is on an extraordinary quest to reach Mount Moral and win the trophy! On her journey, she will encounter tricky situations that will test her ability to make the right choice. <br /><br />This magical Miniclip takes students on an ethical journey to learn about right and wrong, and what consequences are. They will learn about how their choices impact others as well as themselves, and may even discover that in the end it’s not winning a prize that counts, but how they feel inside when they do the right thing…<br /><br />About ClickView:<br />We cover every level of learning - primary, secondary and tertiary, and are ready to help you and your students achieve greater outcomes.
