{% raw %}Please read this video description entirely<br /><br />Comments are disabled on this video because many people wouldn't read the video description and pinned comment before leaving negative comments.<br /><br />(Here was the pinned comment)<br /><br />&quot;Sorry for the lame-ass title, but that's what ppl click on, and it's the type of crap Youtube suggests on viewer's main feed<br />PLEASE READ ENTIRELY BEFORE COMMENTING<br />All TIG welding and fabrication questions are answered at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.6061.com">http://www.6061.com</a> not in this comment section, sorry. Way too many to keep up on, and way too many people are eager to give their own answers which are often incorrect. <br />Aluminum in contact with stainless steel can cause galvanic corrosion when in a humid environment. Please research this on your own and leave it out of the comments section, it has already been addressed in this pinned comment.<br />This is not brazing. Look up the definition of brazing. There is no fusion or bond between the stainless and aluminum. What I am doing is welding aluminum filler rod to the aluminum sheet and mechanically trapping the bolt head.<br /><br />To help put this into better perspective, this single 1/4&quot; stainless bolt attached to an 1/8&quot; aluminum sheet could lift up an entire Geo Metro car.<br />I'm surprised the 3.5 threads on the nut weren't the point of failure.<br /><br />If you have to do this, then the part wasn't designed well. Thicker aluminum with threads, or a simple through hole makes more sense. Please don't waste your time commenting trying to sound smart about how to do this better. This was for demonstration purposes only.&quot;<br /><br />Thanks for watching the 6061 Youtube channel{% endraw %}
