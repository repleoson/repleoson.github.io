{% raw %}Charted at #2 in September 1951. Originally a #8 hit for Ella Fitzgerald with the Chick Webb Orchestra in 1939. Also #10 for Ray Anthony and His Orchestra in November 1951 and #28 for Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians in December 1951. Original Billboard review: &quot;The classic jazz opus is done up Brown with the Ames' pounding out the catchy and infrequently heard lyric. A splendid beat disking which could score, particularly in jukes and with jockeys&quot;. Overall Billboard rating: 87 out of 100. <br /><br /><br /><br />Written by Sydney Robin and Charlie Shavers. <br /><br /><br /><br />The other side of this record is &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; which I've also posted.{% endraw %}
