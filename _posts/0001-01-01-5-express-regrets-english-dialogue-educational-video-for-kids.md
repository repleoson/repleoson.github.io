Is that broken?<br />John: Yea. A wheel fell out.<br />Roy: Oh no, you can’t ride it then?<br />John: I think so too.

I will do something about Mary!<br />Roy: Give it to a service center. They will repair it quickly.<br />Kevin: I just came back from there, it was closed down.<br />John: What? Today is a weekday?<br />Kevin: They were under construction. Oh my goodness!  Nothing is working today!<br />John: Oh no... It's one of your bad days too. I’m so sorry.<br />Kevin:  Oh no!
