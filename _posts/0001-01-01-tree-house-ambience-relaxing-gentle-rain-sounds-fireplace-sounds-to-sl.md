A favorite from childhood, it seemed the perfect choice to keep in your cozy tree house. Rain patters against the roof above and a few droplets trail down the windows. You pause to take in a deep breath of the tree limb at the center of your tree house, savoring the rich scent of nature.<br /> It had been a dream since childhood to have a home away from home in the forest. Now you settle yourself on the couch, peering out into the foggy woodland below. You slide open the first page, admiring the old-fashioned artwork within, and begin to read in perfect tranquility.<br /><br />â–º Please visit our website and check out your favorite soundscapes available to purchase:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gumroad.com/newblissâ€‹â€‹">https://gumroad.com/newblissâ€‹â€‹</a><br /><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br />How this artwork is created:<br />This ambience was modeled and created in 3D .
