{% raw %}Watch Richard Hammond's new show here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/HammondWorkshopYT">https://bit.ly/HammondWorkshopYT</a><br /><br />Hammond's Series 1 E-Type is a thing of beauty, what with its XK straight-six engine, original Moss gearbox and a beautiful colour scheme.
