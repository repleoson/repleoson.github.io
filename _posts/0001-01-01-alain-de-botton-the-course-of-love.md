{% raw %}Recorded June 15, 2016<br /><br />“With originality, verve, and wit” (San Francisco Chronicle), Alain de Botton’s internationally bestselling nonfiction books examine love, work, friendship, travel, and the other fundamentals of everyday life. These works include On Love, How Proust Can Change Your Life, Status Anxiety, and The Architecture of Happiness. The cofounder of the acclaimed School of Life, a London-based international organization dedicated to a new vision of education, de Botton is a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and an honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. His new novel charts the parabolic romantic partnership of an Edinburgh couple from puppy love through the pressures of their average daily existence.{% endraw %}
