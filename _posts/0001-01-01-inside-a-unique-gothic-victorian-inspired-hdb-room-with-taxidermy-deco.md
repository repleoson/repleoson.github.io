{% raw %}This week, we have a very special Halloween episode featuring an unconventional design you don't see too often in Singapore - a Gothic Victorian design. Uli named her room Castle Draculi after her favourite Gothic novel, Dracula. She always liked the Gothic Victorian type of aesthetic, and renovated the room with various details to achieve that medieval look.<br /><br />One of which was the sage green colour as well as the green terrazzo tiles on the floor. Couple that with the frosted detailing on the windows and the overall look is certainly very unique. She has just started her taxidermy collection as well, and a particular interesting new one is the bat! Her favourite piece though, is her writing desk as the vintage style really suits the room and it has various interesting hidden compartments as well. <br /><br />Special thanks to Uli for showing us around her really uniquely designed room.
