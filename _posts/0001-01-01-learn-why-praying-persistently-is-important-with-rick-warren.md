God has commanded us to pray. He wants to answer prayer. He has given us multiple promises about prayer. But, why pray more than once? In this message at Saddleback Church, Pastor Rick Warren helps us understand why God asks us to pray persistently. You'll learn how to approach prayer with a refreshed perspective and how you can understand the ways he is answering your prayers.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />To watch Pastor Rick's previous messages in our Seeking God for a Breakthrough series, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://saddleback.com/seeking.">http://saddleback.com/seeking.</a><br /><br />Connect with our online community during the week at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://saddleback.com/online.">http://saddleback.com/online.</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />(Saddleback Church) (Breakthrough) (Seeking God) (What are you seeking?)
