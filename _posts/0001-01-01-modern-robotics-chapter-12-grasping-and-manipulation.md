{% raw %}This is a video supplement to the book &quot;Modern Robotics:  Mechanics, Planning, and Control,&quot; by Kevin Lynch and Frank Park, Cambridge University Press 2017.  See <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://modernrobotics.org">http://modernrobotics.org</a> for information on the book, free software, and other materials.<br /><br />This video introduces Chapter 12 of &quot;Modern Robotics&quot; on grasping and other types of manipulation.  Examples of non-grasping (nonprehensile) manipulation include pushing, carrying a tray of glasses, vibratory transport, and the meter-stick trick.  Such manipulation tasks are analyzed based on contact kinematics, contact forces, and rigid-body dynamics.  This video also introduces the definitions of the linear span, positive (conical) span, and convex span of a set of vectors, concepts that are commonly used in robot manipulation.<br /><br />This video is a brief summary of material from the book, and it is not meant to stand alone.  For more details, such as an explanation of the notation, please consult the book and the other videos.<br /><br />Playlist for Chapter 12:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLggLP4f-rq03J3TLUyIW0ZGfejrTjHayw">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLggLP4f-rq03J3TLUyIW0ZGfejrTjHayw</a><br /><br />Playlist for all book videos:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLggLP4f-rq02vX0OQQ5vrCxbJrzamYDfx">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLggLP4f-rq02vX0OQQ5vrCxbJrzamYDfx</a><br /><br />YouTube channel with all playlists:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kevinl2145">https://www.youtube.com/user/kevinl2145</a><br /><br />Wiki for the book, including software and other supplements:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://modernrobotics.org">http://modernrobotics.org</a><br /><br />Modern Robotics is now a series of online courses on Coursera!  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics">https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics</a>{% endraw %}
