{% raw %}In today's 5-Minute Cards video, I embossed a background and then stenciled a large snowflake on top! The embossing underneath adds an extra layer of elegance to the look and it's a quick and easy card that you can make in just five minutes! Of course, you can add another minute or two and add sequins like I did in my finished card. I'm a firm believer in a little bling on a holiday card like this one!<br />Also, do you see the sneak peek item that I used on this card? Please let me know in the comments below if you do. <br /><br />Stencil:<br />Stellar Snowflake<br /><br />Background Stamp:<br />Petite Flourish<br /><br />In Pad Colors:<br />Turquoise Sea<br />Wild Wisteria<br /><br />Fine detail white embossing powder<br />Embossing and Watermark Ink<br /><br />You can find our products here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3CUkRMH">https://bit.ly/3CUkRMH</a><br /><br />Thanks so much for watching!<br />Hugs,<br />Gina K.{% endraw %}
