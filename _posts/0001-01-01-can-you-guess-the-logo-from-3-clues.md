{% raw %}Here's a fun new logo quiz: guess the logo from the 3 clues! For this quiz, I have lined up 50 logos. One by one you will be shown 3 clues and your challenge is to guess the logo before time runs out. And if you're quick you're earning points: the sooner you can guess the logo, the more points you will get! How many logos can you guess correctly under time pressure? If you keep score, share your score in the comments.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this video, please share your thoughts in the comments, I'd love to hear from you!
