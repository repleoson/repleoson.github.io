{% raw %}Learn how to replace the ENTIRE front suspension of your car in this two episode series. Here I will show you how to install a brand new wheel bearing, ball joints, control arms, tie rod, strut, and axle. <br /><br />The ball joint and wheel bearing has to be pressed into the knuckle and I have a bunch of tips and tricks to make that easy. I show how to properly install a tie rod (safely) and get an accurate measurement so you can get the car aligned. I also show you how to properly torque down bolts with bushings so you don't tear them. The rest of the suspension parts are pretty simple to install and then we go for a ride to see how much better the car handles! <br /><br />First EPISODE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2fJ_aM_T0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2fJ_aM_T0</a><br /><br />How to Replace Sway Bar End Links: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnrARhxhaSo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnrARhxhaSo</a><br />How to Replace Wheel Bearing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe_WtKIKlYA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe_WtKIKlYA</a><br /><br />Tools and Products:<br />Mevotech Suspension Parts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2VKrmfr">https://amzn.to/2VKrmfr</a><br />Rust Paint: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Dg5yAV">https://amzn.to/2Dg5yAV</a><br />Impact gun: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2It3KIo">https://amzn.to/2It3KIo</a><br />Torque Wrench: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2UO2yFY">https://amzn.to/2UO2yFY</a><br />Bearing Press: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Gh8tv3">https://amzn.to/2Gh8tv3</a><br />Ball Joint Press: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2UTxEvR">https://amzn.to/2UTxEvR</a><br />Silicone Paste: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2DsSisN">https://amzn.to/2DsSisN</a> <br />Grease Gun: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Iy11hm">https://amzn.to/2Iy11hm</a><br />Chassis Grease: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2IGc2g5">https://amzn.to/2IGc2g5</a><br /><br />→ Become a ChrisFix Subscriber: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=paintballoo7">http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=paintballoo7</a><br />→ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/chrisfixit">https://www.instagram.com/chrisfixit</a><br />→ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/chrisfix8">https://www.facebook.com/chrisfix8</a><br />→ Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ChrisFixed.com">http://www.ChrisFixed.com</a><br />→ My Channel Home Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/ChrisFix">https://www.youtube.com/ChrisFix</a><br /><br />**If the video was helpful, remember to give it a &quot;thumbs up&quot; and consider subscribing.**<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />Due to factors beyond the control of ChrisFix, I cannot guarantee against improper use or unauthorized modifications of this information.
