Whatever it is, you enter into the action as though you were an actor in the part. You do not sit back and visualize yourself doing it. You do it.“ - Neville Goddard<br /><br />„Do not visualize yourself doing it, feel yourself doing it. If you are going to shake a man's hand, do not visualize yourself shaking his hand, imagine your friend is standing before you and shake his hand. But leave your physical hands immobilized and imagine that your greater hand, which is your imaginary hand, is actually shaking his hand.“ - Neville Goddard<br /><br />„All you need do is to imagine that you are doing it. You are stretched out in time, and what you are doing, which seems to be a controlled day dream, is an actual act in the greater dimension of your being. You are actually encountering an event fourth-dimensionally before you encounter it here in the three-dimensions of space, and you do not have to raise a finger to bring that state to pass.“ - Neville Goddard<br /><br />„You do not visualize yourself at a distance in point of space and at a distance in point of time being congratulated on your good fortune. Instead, you MAKE elsewhere HERE and the future NOW. The difference between FEELING yourself in action, here and now , and visualizing yourself in action, as though you were on a motion-picture screen, is the difference between success and failure.“ - Neville Goddard<br /><br />„The difference will be appreciated if you will now visualize yourself climbing a ladder. Then, with eyelids closed imagine that a ladder is right in front of you and FEEL YOURSELF ACTUALLY CLIMBING IT.“ - Neville Goddard<br /><br /><br />#lawofassumption​​​​​​ #selfconcept​​​​​​ #nevillegoddard​​​​​​ #imagination​​​​​​ #awareness​​​​​​ #consciousness​​​​​​ #imaginingcreatesreality​​​​​​ #iam​​​​​​ #gesetzderannahme​​{% endraw %}
