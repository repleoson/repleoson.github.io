{% raw %}:: Behind the Scenes :: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.wendyslookbook.com/2011/04/behind-the-scenes-25-ways-to-wear-a-scarf/">http://www.wendyslookbook.com/2011/04/behind-the-scenes-25-ways-to-wear-a-scarf/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />The Infinity vs. DIY Infinity =D :: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://wendyslookbook.com">http://wendyslookbook.com</a> <br /><br />The difference is very subtle - the first fold. The Infinity is folded along the diagonal while the DIY Infinity is folded in half, horizontally. The Infinity starts off as a triangle, whereas the DIY Infinity begins as a rectangle. It seems like a trivial difference, but due to the shape, the Infinity fold works best with square scarves whereas the DIY version can be pulled off on thicker longer scarves. Also, because of  the different starting shapes, the way the scarves drape are also slightly different. I wanted to include both in case people had trouble with the Infinity fold on their scarves, but due to the speed of the video, the first step was a bit harder to convey :(<br /><br /><br /><br />For scarf tutorial videos on how to tie these styles, please select which box you would like to see at the end.  Scarves are great for every season - from light chiffon scarves for Spring and Summer to voluminous cashmere scarves for Fall to thick wool scarves for Winter - scarves are the perfect accessory to compliment any outfit.
