{% raw %}It is obvious <br /><br />may I say, oh baby, that it is found on another plane? <br /><br />Yes I can creep into cupboards, sleep in the hall <br /><br />your stars - my stars, a simple cock bar <br /><br />only an impulse - pie in the sky <br /><br />mumble listen dolly <br /><br />drift over your mind - holly <br /><br />creep into bed when your head's on the ground <br /><br />she held the torch on the porch, <br /><br />she winked an eye <br /><br /><br /><br />Reason it is written on the brambles <br /><br />stranded on the spikes - my blood red, oh listen: <br /><br />remember those times I could call <br /><br />through the clear day <br /><br />time - be there... <br /><br />braver and braver, a handkerchief waver <br /><br />the louder you lips to a loud hailer <br /><br />growing together, they ('re) growing each either <br /><br />no wondering, stumbling, fumbling <br /><br />rumbling minds shot together, <br /><br />our minds shot together... <br /><br /><br /><br />So equally over a valley, a hill <br /><br />wood on quarry stood, each of us crying <br /><br />a velvet curtain of gray <br /><br />mark the blanket where the sparrows play <br /><br />and the trees by the waving corn stranded <br /><br />my legs move the last empty inches to you <br /><br />the softness, the warmth from the weather in suspense <br /><br />mote to a grog - the star a white chalk <br /><br />minds shot together, our minds shot together...{% endraw %}
