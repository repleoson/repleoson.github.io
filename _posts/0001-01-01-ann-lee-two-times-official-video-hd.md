She is known solely for her 1999 hit single &quot;2 Times&quot;.<br /><br />Having moved to live in Italy in the late 1980s, Lee was talent-scouted, and was used as the lead singer on a series of Eurodance singles, issued under various aliases. These have included Charme, Anne, Ally &amp; Jo, DJ Space'C, Lolita, A Kay BJ, Alex, Wienna and TH Express.[citation needed] She also released a few Eurobeat solo singles on the Italian label A.Beat-C. under the names Annerley Gordon and Annalise. Gordon is credited with contributing to the composition of &quot;Rhythm of the Night&quot;, released in Italy in December 1993 on the DWA record label, by the Eurodance project Corona.<br /><br />Her first solo single under the name &quot;Ann Lee&quot; was &quot;2 Times&quot;, originally released in 1998. It was re-released in early 1999 and became a Top 10 hit in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Norway, as well as in Australia and New Zealand. It also hit number 2 in her native United Kingdom, and reached number one in Flanders and Denmark. In Canada it reached number 14 on the singles chart. &quot;2 Times&quot; was featured in the 2001 film Head Over Heels as the movie's theme song.{% endraw %}
