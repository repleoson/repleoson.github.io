{% raw %}You won't believe what a pouring artist can paint with over 400 toothpicks. Be amazed!<br />I got the idea at a barbecue where there were also toothpicks lying around. I made a test picture and was thrilled. This painting method creates very beautiful works of art. <br /><br />The acrylic paints I diluted with water before painting, which colors I use and how the correct mixing ratio is made you can see in this step by step video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/cagHGb0oapo">https://youtu.be/cagHGb0oapo</a><br /><br />With this technique you must have some patience, the acrylic paints must flow slowly over the edges of the toothpicks. This is the only way to get a nice mixture.<br /><br />If you want to paint more pictures, you can reuse the toothpicks, you just have to let them dry.<br /><br />Creative greetings<br />Tiktus<br /><br />#painting #fluidart #abstractpainting{% endraw %}
