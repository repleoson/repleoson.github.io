{% raw %}In this video, you will learn a couple of English presentation expressions you can use to begin a presentation and get the audience's attention. What you'll learn is how to use a simple question or statement that'll quickly engage your audience. <br /> <br />Why a question or statement?<br />A good question or statement at the start of your presentation can quickly get the audience's attention and keep it throughout your presentation... <br /> <br />Like a good suspense or mystery<br />Suspense or mystery writers always put questions into the viewer or reader's mind...
