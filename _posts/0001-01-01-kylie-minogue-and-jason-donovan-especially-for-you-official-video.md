{% raw %}Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan’s Christmas 1988 single “Especially For You” actually hit the top spot in the UK on 1st January 1989 and went on to sell a million copies in that territory alone. It remains producers Stock Aitken and Waterman’s biggest seller in Britain and Kylie’s second biggest behind “Can’t Get You Out Of My Head”. The track also made the top 10 in their native Australia, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and Switzerland. <br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Especially for you<br />I want to let you know what I was going through<br />All the time we were apart<br />I thought of you<br />You were in my heart<br />My love never changed<br />I still feel the same<br />Especially for you<br />I want to tell you I was feeling that way too<br />And if dreams were wings, you know<br />I would have flown to you<br />To be where you are<br />No matter how far<br />And now that I'm next to you<br />No more dreaming about tomorrow<br />Forget the loneliness and the sorrow<br />I've got to say<br />It's all because of you<br />And now we're back together, together<br />I want to show you my heart is oh so true<br />And all the love I have is<br />Especially for you<br />Especially for you<br />I want to tell you, you mean all the world to me<br />How I'm certain that our love was meant to be<br />You changed my life<br />You showed me the way<br />And now that I'm next to you<br />I've waited long enough to find you<br />I want to put all the hurt behind you<br />Oh,<br />And I want to bring out all the love inside you<br />Oh<br />And now we're back together, together<br />I want to show you my heart is oh so true<br />And all the love I have is<br />Especially for you<br />You were in my heart<br />My love never changed<br />And now we're back together, together<br />I want to show you my heart is oh so true<br />And all the love I have is<br />Especially for you<br />Songwriters: Mike Stock / Matt Aitken / Peter Waterman<br />Especially for You lyrics © Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, Universal Music Publishing Group<br /><br />Step Back In Time – The Definitive Collection is out 28th June 2019.<br />Pre-order here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kylie.lnk.to/backintimeID">https://kylie.lnk.to/backintimeID</a><br />Special editions available here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kylie.lnk.to/StoreID">https://kylie.lnk.to/StoreID</a><br /><br />Follow Kylie:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.kylie.com">http://www.kylie.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/kylieminogue">https://www.facebook.com/kylieminogue</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kylieminogue">https://www.instagram.com/kylieminogue</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/kylieminogue">https://twitter.com/kylieminogue</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bmg.lnk.to/khpad">https://bmg.lnk.to/khpad</a><br /><br />#Kylie #Jason #EspeciallyForYou #KylieMinogue #JasonDonovan #1988 #1989 #PWL #StockAitkenWaterman #TenGoodReasons{% endraw %}
