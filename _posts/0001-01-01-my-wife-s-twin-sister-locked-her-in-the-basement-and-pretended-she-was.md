{% raw %}#livinginbasement #animatedstories #wnews<br /><br />I knew my wife had a sister, but I never met her because they had stopped talking a long time ago… One evening my wife’s sister called her in panic and tears and told her she’d been in an accident… My wife immediately rushed to help her, but she had no idea how that trip would turn out.<br /><br />When my wife returned home, she was like a different person. I could barely recognize my beloved woman in her. She started going somewhere every night, and one night I decided to follow her. I wanted to find out what was wrong and what she was hiding from me.<br /><br />I wish I had never gone there…{% endraw %}
