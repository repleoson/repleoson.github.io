{% raw %}HOW I AFFORD TO LIVE MY DREAM LIFE WITH NO INCOME? LET'S TALK ABOUT MONEY.<br /><br />I've hesitated for a long time whether I should make this video because I believe that everyone who's going through a period of (self) unemployment is going to have a very different strategy around money and supporting yourself. <br /><br />This is NOT a financial advice but simply me sharing my own experience and my own take on managing my finances so I can live my dream life while being self-unemployed. <br /><br />Any questions, leave them in the comments below.<br /><br />Hugs,<br />TWG x<br />- - -<br />Timestamps:<br />0:00 - Why I didn't want to make this video<br />02:28 - My savings<br />09:19 - Location &amp; living costs<br />11:39 - Financial support<br />13:40 - Outro<br /><br />#unemployed #dreamlife #money{% endraw %}
