In this video, I give you an overview of how a CEA is performed and what special considerations there are in radiology. I use an example of osteoporosis screening, but note that I do not do it exactly as in the study referenced below! it is just to give you an idea and overview.<br /><br />References:<br />Osteoporosis Screening: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28613988">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28613988</a><br />Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in Radiology <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30416003">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30416003</a><br /><br />#agten<br />#radiology<br />#CEA<br /><br />Please subscribe to my channel and also check out my patreon page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/agten">https://www.patreon.com/agten</a> <br /><br />Patreon is an online system, where you can support me on a more personal level with a tiny donation in exchange for small benefits, as listed on my page.
