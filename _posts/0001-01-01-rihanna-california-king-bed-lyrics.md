{% raw %}The Lyrics ; <br /><br />Chest to chest<br />Nose to nose<br />Palm to palm<br />We were always just that close<br />Wrist to wrist<br />Toe to toe<br />Lips that just felt like the inside of a rose<br />So how come when I reach out my fingers<br />It feels like more than distance between us<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />In this california king bed<br />We're ten thousand miles apart<br />I bet california wishing on these stars for your heart for me<br />My california king<br /><br />Eye to eye<br />Cheek to cheek<br />Side by side<br />You were sleeping next to me<br />Arm to arm<br />Dusk to dawn<br />With the curtains drawn<br />And a little last nitgh on these sheets<br />So how come when I reach out my fingers<br />It feels like more than distance between us<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />In this california king bed<br />We're ten thousand miles apart<br />I bet california wishing on these stars of the heart for me<br />My california king<br /><br />Just when I felt like giving up on us<br />You turned around and gave me one last touch<br />That made everything feel better<br />And even then my eyes got better<br />So confused wanna ask you if you love me<br />But I dont wanna seem so weak<br />Maybe I've been california dreaming<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />In this california king bed<br />We're ten thousand miles apart<br />I bet california wishing on these stars of the heart for me<br />My california king<br /><br />In this california king bed<br />We're ten thousand miles apart<br />I bet california wishing on these stars of the heart for me<br />My california king{% endraw %}
