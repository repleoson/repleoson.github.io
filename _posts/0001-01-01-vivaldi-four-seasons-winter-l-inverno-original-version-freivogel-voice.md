Cynthia Miller Freivogel, baroque violin and the award winning Early Music ensemble Voices of Music.<br />Q.  What are period instruments or original instruments; how are they different from modern instruments?<br />A. As instruments became modernized in the 19th century, builders and players tended to focus on the volume of sound and the stability of tuning. Modern steel strings replaced the older materials, and instruments were often machine made. Historical instruments, built individually by hand and with overall lighter construction, have extremely complex overtonesâ€”which we find delightful. Modern instruments are of course perfectly suited to more modern music.<br />Voices of Music is creating a worldwide digital library of music videos, recordings and editions, free for anyone in the world.
