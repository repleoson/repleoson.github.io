{% raw %}I didn't know Cavetown wrote the lyrics to the song &quot;Cut My Hair&quot;, which gained​ popularity  fast. Only until someone commented about the song &quot;This Is Home&quot; I was curious so I checked it out and had to make a video for it.<br /><br />Make sure to follow and listen to our Spotify Playlist for all of our favorite uploaded songs! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3Pa6VktapmeHefhLtPNuc3">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3Pa6VktapmeHefhLtPNuc3</a><br /><br /><br />Show Cavetown some love and listen to him singing this song again ❤️<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/75g1G4O5fco">https://youtu.be/75g1G4O5fco</a><br /><br />Support Cavetown ⇟ ⇟ ⇟<br />∑<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://cavetown.bandcamp.com/">http://cavetown.bandcamp.com/</a><br />∑<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/metaIpuppy">https://twitter.com/metaIpuppy</a><br />∑<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lemon.socks/">https://www.instagram.com/lemon.socks/</a><br />∑<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/fluffybluehat">https://www.youtube.com/user/fluffybluehat</a><br />∑<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/cavetown">https://soundcloud.com/cavetown</a><br />∑<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cavetown.co.uk/">https://www.cavetown.co.uk/</a> <br /><br />Artwok // Phazed  :<br />∑<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://superphazed.tumblr.com">https://superphazed.tumblr.com</a> <br />∑<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/instaphazed/">https://www.instagram.com/instaphazed/</a><br />∑<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://society6.com/Phazed/">https://society6.com/Phazed/</a><br />∑<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/phazed">https://www.patreon.com/phazed</a><br /><br /><br />Edit: &quot;Cut My Hair&quot; is a remix of this song (the original).

Sometimes I think I’m dead<br />Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head<br />But I don’t wanna fall asleep just yet<br /><br />My eyes went dark<br />I don’t know where<br />My pupils are<br />But I’ll figure out a way to get us out of here<br /><br />Get a load of this monster<br />He doesn’t know how to communicate<br />His mind is in a different place<br />Will everybody please give him a little bit of space?<br /><br />Get a load of this trainwreck<br />His hair’s a mess and he doesn’t know who he is yet<br />But little do we know, the stars<br />Welcome him with open arms<br /><br />Time is<br />Slowly<br />Tracing his face<br />But strangely he feels at home in this place<br /><br /><br /><br />I don't own anything! Nor do I make any profit out of ANY of my uploads. Support the artist(s) of this song and show them more love than me. I'm just promoting music because I feel they need recognition.{% endraw %}
