{% raw %}I tried a little bit of a different editing style, let me know if you like it! I am so excited to finally bring this video to you! I have been planning it since we knew we were moving in, and although it is no where near finished, I am excited to show you progress! We came to Georgia with nothing but a couple car loads full of our essentials, and have been able to start fresh with furniture pieces and decor. It was important for us to stay budget friendly, and I am so happy to bring to you some of my advice! <br /><br />Please leave requests and comments below.
