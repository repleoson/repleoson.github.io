{% raw %}After 17 days of trekking and 7 videos later, I'm sad to say that the Cape Wrath Trail is finally over. Thank you so much for joining my journey through this rugged landscape of the scottish highlands, over mountains passes, through glens, river, bogs and small villages - I finally made it to that iconic lighthouse that sits on the remote and desolate shores of Cape Wrath (UK's most north westerly point) <br /><br />This has had to be one of the most enjoyable and challenging experiences of my life and I loved every second of it! It was so nice to come home to a dry bed and clothes, a hot shower and some wholesome food but the trail still yearns within me and that easy and beautiful way of life I led for over 2 weeks. <br /><br />Scotland had so much to offer and I loved backpacking solo through the remote sections of it. In this episode, I hike from Rhonich where I wild camped the night before over to sandwood for the night, where I went for a swim! Then my final day... to the Cape Wrath Lighthouse and back.. one of my hardest stages. <br /><br />Was lovely meeting so many nice people along the way - you know who you are! Thank you for making this trip even more special. Also, thank you for all the amazing comments, its so lovely to hear :))<br /><br />Thanks for the inspo @Haze Outdoors @Fit for Adventure <br /><br />Have a good one - Becks xox<br /><br />Yvonne &amp; Fritz Insta - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/dalesway_therapies?utm_medium=copy_link">https://instagram.com/dalesway_therapies?utm_medium=copy_link</a><br /><br /><br />Please take a look and support my Patreon Page  - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/girloutdoors">https://www.patreon.com/girloutdoors</a><br /><br />Freeze Dried Meals - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://basecampfood.com/collections/dried-meals">https://basecampfood.com/collections/dried-meals</a><br />Titanium Pot and Spoon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wildcampinginternational.com/shop">https://wildcampinginternational.com/shop</a><br />Kendal Mint bars affiliate link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kendalmint.co.uk/?atid=68">https://www.kendalmint.co.uk/?atid=68</a><br />DISCOUNT ( 10% code: girloutdoorsbecky10 )<br />Castrom Knife  - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.casstrom.co.uk/products/safari-mini-hunter-in-black-g10">https://www.casstrom.co.uk/products/safari-mini-hunter-in-black-g10</a><br />Vallon Glasses - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vallon.store/collections/mens-sunglasses/products/waylons">https://vallon.store/collections/mens-sunglasses/products/waylons</a><br />Jetboil MightyMo - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.burton-mccall.co.uk/brand/jetboil/">https://www.burton-mccall.co.uk/brand/jetboil/</a><br />Down Jacket - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rab.equipment/uk/women-s-electron-pro-jacket">https://rab.equipment/uk/women-s-electron-pro-jacket</a><br />Hiking shoes - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.altrarunning.eu/uk/w-lone-peak-5-2845.html">https://www.altrarunning.eu/uk/w-lone-peak-5-2845.html</a><br />Solar Panel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.anker.com/ca/products/variant/anker-powerport-solar/A2421011">https://www.anker.com/ca/products/variant/anker-powerport-solar/A2421011</a><br />Camera - SONY ZV1 High Performance Compact Vlogging Camera <br />Go Pro 7 Silver <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/girl_outdoors_becky/">https://www.instagram.com/girl_outdoors_becky/</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Girl-Outdoors-398344493957243/">https://www.facebook.com/Girl-Outdoors-398344493957243/</a>{% endraw %}
