{% raw %}Today there is a new nutrition reality. It is a reality where undernutrition (such as micronutrient deficiencies, stunting and wasting) , overweight, obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes and cancer now coexist in the same countries, communities, households and even individuals. This is what is called the double burden of malnutrition which impacts not only our health but also that of future generations, the health of our planet and our economies.<br /><br />This video is designed to help viewers better understand this double burden of malnutrition and its drivers. It aims to raise awareness and  contribute to the global dialogue and much needed new narrative and action to achieve better health through nutrition.{% endraw %}
