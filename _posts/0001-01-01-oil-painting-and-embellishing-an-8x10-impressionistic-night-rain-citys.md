{% raw %}Watch me oil paint this Night Rain City Scene in minutes. It was a small canvas, 8x10, and in reality it probably took me at least 2 hours. I painted the canvas black and drew with white. When I do night city paintings I like to paint from light to dark. Otherwise, I usually paint from dark to light.<br />    Painted in 2019, and I'm happy to report that the painting sold, and 25% of the sales went to an animal charity. I'm not sure which one, either ASPCA, Best Friends no kill shelter, Sea Shepherds, World Wildlife Fund....{% endraw %}
