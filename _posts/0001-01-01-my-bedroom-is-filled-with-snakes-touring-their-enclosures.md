{% raw %}finishing up all the snake habitats and their lil diy backgrounds in my room! also, a lil chat at the start of the video updating y'all about my rats, and how bringing them into my life turned out. this is the SECOND part of the trilogy of videos i'm posting. All three videos revolve around building and going through all the new setups for my reptiles.<br />-----------------------------------------<br />PART ONE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44P4SN11dxE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44P4SN11dxE</a><br />PART THREE: *not posted yet*<br />------------------------------------------<br />today we're focusing on the completed enclosures for a variety of snakes who are residing in my bedroom. Due to the way the placement of the new enclosures worked best, I unintentionally ended up with my room being occupied by absolutely nothing but snakes. There are still more guys and gals in the other rooms!! So please don't worry about those you didn't see. Unless I have mentioned that the animal was rehomed or passed away, their cages are just in another room.<br />-------------------------------------------<br />WATCH MORE:<br />My Latest Videos - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/6Bwvua">https://goo.gl/6Bwvua</a><br />CLICK TO SUBSCRIBE, IT'S WHAT THE FURBIES NEED: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/1GlVxm">https://goo.gl/1GlVxm</a> <br />------------------<br />FOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:<br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/taylorndean">http://www.twitter.com/taylorndean</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/taylorndean">http://www.instagram.com/taylorndean</a><br />-----------------<br /><br />#Reptiles #DIY #Snakes<br /><br />(messing with the features on here and put my video location as the state I live in...a lot of people don't realize i live in texas, but i really do not like texas right now pls do not associate me with the news and politics coming out of texas lately thx xoxo){% endraw %}
