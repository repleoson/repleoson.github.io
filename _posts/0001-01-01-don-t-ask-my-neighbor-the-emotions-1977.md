{% raw %}I think this is one of my all-time favorite ballads.  It just holds a special place in my heart, because well, I remember having a &quot;crush&quot; on someone and this song was playing in the background :)  I was only a little kid, but wished I could be with that &quot;special someone&quot;  LOL<br /><br />Now, this song is always playing when I'm with that special one :){% endraw %}
