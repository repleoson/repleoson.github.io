{% raw %}Help Will Come Tomorrow is a survival game with an emphasis on character relationships and crafting and it is mighty splendid too! We look after four characters who are abandoned in the Russian Siberian wilderness in 1917 when their train is attacked.<br /><br />They escape their attackers but have to set up camp and also attempt to search for supplies in order to survive. But what do we prioritise first? Food? Water? Shelter? Medical provision?<br /><br />We also have to deal with the relationships between our four characters, all of whom have different personalities and ideologies, from the revolutionaries to the aristocrat with the neutral in the middle.<br /><br />We experience illness, a dramatic chase around our destroyed train and a somewhat feeble attempt to catch a hare.<br /><br />So how do we get on? Do we manage to survive in Siberia? Does... help come tomorrow?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqCa31-K_PjmEty8WX3whyw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqCa31-K_PjmEty8WX3whyw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Help Will Come Tomorrow can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1119600/Help_Will_Come_Tomorrow/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1119600/Help_Will_Come_Tomorrow/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />----------------------------<br /><br /><br /><br />If you’d like to connect with me, you can find me on...<br /><br /><br /><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/BccyEWv">https://discord.gg/BccyEWv</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheGeekCupboard">https://twitter.com/TheGeekCupboard</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/thegeekcupboard">https://www.patreon.com/thegeekcupboard</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheGeekCupboard/">https://www.facebook.com/TheGeekCupboard/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Reddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGeekCupboard/">https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGeekCupboard/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />----------------------------<br /><br /><br /><br />In a uninhabitable Siberian wilderness, in a wake of October Revolution, a group of passengers survives the mysterious catastrophe of Trans-Siberian railway train. They must endure in a harsh ice-clad climate until rescue arrives. Facing many dangers, their own weaknesses and, above all, their own prejudice. People from different social classes have to unite and make decisions that often go against their beliefs, either by putting them to the test or by completely breaking them. Will they survive and at what cost is only up to the player.<br /><br />The basic mechanics of the game will focus on the survival of the characters (meeting their needs, gathering resources, expanding the camp, taking care of security, exploring surroundings), but the player will quickly find out that in order to win, he needs much more: to learn the personality of the characters and work out relations between them, mitigating conflicts and taking care of the morale. You may choose to act selfish but it is cooperation that will allow you to win and keep clear conscience.<br /><br />In Help Will Come Tomorrow you will:<br />• Overcome class animosities between your party members in order to survive in an innovative class relations building system.<br />• Manage scarce resources and stay alive in frosty wilderness of Siberia before help arrives.<br />• Guide 9 unique characters coming from different social origins and grouping in three society classes<br />• Discover intimate stories and past of all party members<br />• Build and expand your own camp to increase the chances of survival<br />• Face dynamically changing weather conditions and unforgiving Siberian wildlife affecting survivors life.<br />• Experience in-game Event system based on characters relations and morale<br />• Immerse yourself in touching story set in 1917 pre - Bolschevik Imperial Russia<br /><br /><br /><br />----------------------------<br /><br /><br /><br />Graphics designed by Penge in The Geek Cupboard.<br /><br /><br /><br />Additional audio:<br /><br />Music to Delight Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br /><br />Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a>{% endraw %}
