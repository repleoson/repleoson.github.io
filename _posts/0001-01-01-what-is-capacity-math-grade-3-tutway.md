Every video will make the academic base of the child stronger.<br /><br />I hope you liked our video.<br />Kids should spend time watching informative videos and expand their knowledge day by day.<br />Kids retain what they see in audio-visual lessons so make them watch informative videos rather than cramming things.<br /><br />If you want to learn any topic, please free to write to us, we will upload the video to help you out as soon as possible.<br />We can also create a customized u tube playlist for the topics you want to learn.<br />Your feedback is important to us.<br /><br />Stay connected with us:<br />tutwayhelpdesk@gmail.com<br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL-KeqwBmYvEBpAiUOmkIQw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL-KeqwBmYvEBpAiUOmkIQw</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/tutway/">https://www.facebook.com/tutway/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tutway.com/">https://www.tutway.com/</a><br />About us:<br />Welcome to Tutway.<br />A unique platform where learning is fun.<br />Now there is no distinction between kids’ fun time and study time.<br />At Tutway, we believe in a very simple idea that audio-visual learning is the most effective tool for grasping knowledge. Many researchers have proven that kids learn a lot by playing interactive games and watching audio-visual animated lessons as compared to reading from books.<br /><br />That's when Tutway comes to the rescue.<br />Tutway is a supplementary education program where kids can learn at their own pace. The students can watch animated videos that are so meticulously made that they can understand even the most complex concepts very easily. There is a question bank at the end of each video where students can answer those questions multiple times and test whether they have grasped knowledge completely or not.<br />We have information systems embedded in the program where parents can monitor real-time performance of their kids and get up to date information about their performance, including quizzes attempted and the marks got in each quiz, both in tabular and graphical formats. Regular reports are e-mailed to the parents so that the parents can analyze their kids’ performance.<br />If we want to learn high-level concepts, we should have a clear understanding of the basic concepts. For instance, if kids don't know about addition and subtraction, they cannot do multiplication, and if they don't know about multiplication, they cannot do division, and if they don't have knowledge of these four basic operations, Algebra cannot be done by them, and it goes on and on.<br />The same applies to the English language if kids don't have sound knowledge of grammar and vocabulary; it becomes extremely difficult for them to have their communication skills.<br />Knowledge of the scientific concepts is also required for observing physical, chemical, biological phenomena happening all around us.<br />That is why; Tutway has thousands of animated videos on Maths, English, and Science to clear the basics of these subjects. It perfectly suits most of the educational needs of most of the students, regardless of their learning abilities.<br />So hurry up, download the Tutway app and book a free-demo class to make education interactive and fun experience.{% endraw %}
