{% raw %}New Single from The Alternate Routes. Nothing More was written for and inspired by the work of our friends at Newtown Kindness. The Nothing More single was featured on the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, as well as the December 17th 2013 NCIS episode titled 'Homesick' (Season 11 Episode 11).<br /><br />The video is old 8mm home movie footage of Tim's sister Katie. We hope you enjoy the song and would love it if you made a video of your own  footage (new or old) and sync it up with Nothing More to share with friends and share with us. <br /><br />Available on iTunes<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/HkZB6v">http://goo.gl/HkZB6v</a><br /><br />Lyrics can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/3CezcF">http://goo.gl/3CezcF</a><br /><br />Thealternateroutes.com<br /><br />Newtownkindness.org{% endraw %}
