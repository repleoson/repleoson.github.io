It’s a part that requires technical prowess, a creative approach, and just straight up grit and grind. <br /><br />So what is link building? <br /><br />Here’s the standard definition. Link building is the process of getting other websites to link to a page on your website. And these hyperlinks are called backlinks. <br /><br />However, most people can’t seem to get the link building process right. This ultimately boils down to execution. <br /><br />The reason why execution is tough is because people focus too much on the end result, i.e. getting backlinks to their pages. The process is actually very relational. And relationships are built by humans, not “borrowed” templates from videos and blog posts. <br /><br />So, here’s a better definition: link building is the process of building relationships with other relevant site owners who want and will link to your content because it enhances theirs.<br /><br />It includes relationships, relevance, and a value exchange.<br /><br />Since link building is tough, you need to understand why it’s worth the effort. In short, backlinks are used by search engines like Google to help rank web pages. And the reason for this is something called PageRank. <br /><br />Why does PageRank matter and how does PageRank work? You’ll learn all about it in the video. <br /><br />Once you’ve understood how PageRank works, you’ll want to know how to get backlinks to your site. <br /><br />There are 3 ways to get them. <br />► Create backlinks<br />► Buy backlinks<br />► Earn backlinks<br /><br />Out of the three, only one of them is truly valuable. In the tutorial, you’ll learn which one that is. <br /><br />However, not all backlinks are good. Only some are really valuable. <br /><br />To understand what makes a link good, there are two main categories you should look at. <br />► Relevance<br />► Authoritativeness<br /><br />In the video, you’ll learn what these two concepts mean and how you can evaluate links for these two qualities. <br /><br />Once you’ve understood everything before this, you’ll want to know what link building strategies you can use. <br /><br />And in the video, we’ll share the link building strategies that actually work. <br /><br />Timestamps:<br /><br />0:41 - What is link building<br />1:22 - Main ideas behind link building<br />1:55 - What is PageRank<br />3:34 - How do you get backlinks<br />4:59 - How to define good backlinks<br />6:48 - What are Ahrefs Domain and URL ratings<br />7:23 - Hyperlink structure and attributes <br />10:54 - Definition of a ‘linkable content’<br />12:52 - Importance of a ‘pitch’ for the outreach<br />15:38 - Guest blogging<br />16:31 - Resource page link building<br />17:38 - Broken link building<br />18:35 - Link building with HARO<br /><br />#linkbuildingforbeginners #linkbuilding #backlinks<br /><br />Be sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br /><br /><br />STAY TUNED:<br /><br />Ahrefs ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ahrefs.com/">https://ahrefs.com/</a><br /><br />YouTube ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Facebook ►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Ahrefs">https://www.facebook.com/Ahrefs</a><br /><br />Twitter ►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ahrefs">https://twitter.com/ahrefs</a>{% endraw %}
