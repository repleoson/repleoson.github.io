{% raw %}Official music video for One Another by Mac DeMarco off his album, This Old Dog. <br />Mac Demarco stars in his very own tale as old as time, fish out of water, buddy flick. Whilst relaxing in bed Mac befriends a real unlikely character, Death. Their friendship has one draw back, they can look but cannot touch. &quot;Man the chemistry between the two leads is palpable on screen.&quot; - Professional Reviewer. <br />Keep your eyes peeled for the M. Night Shyamalan style twist at the end. You're not gonna wanna miss this one for the world!<br /><br />Buy This Old Dog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.omnianmusicgroup.com/products/this-old-dog">https://www.omnianmusicgroup.com/products/this-old-dog</a><br /><br />Follow Mac on Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Sz7ZnJQBIHsXLUSo0OQtM?si=0HLc4UULTs-cgQAJ-UlsFA">https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Sz7ZnJQBIHsXLUSo0OQtM?si=0HLc4UULTs-cgQAJ-UlsFA</a><br /><br />Visit Mac's Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macdemarco">https://www.youtube.com/user/macdemarco</a><br /><br />Connect on Social:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MacDeMarcoBand/">https://www.facebook.com/MacDeMarcoBand/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/macdemarco/">https://www.instagram.com/macdemarco/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/msldemarco">https://twitter.com/msldemarco</a><br /><br />More From Mac DeMarco:<br />My Kind of Woman (Official Video): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIuBcb2T55Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIuBcb2T55Q</a><br />Another One (Official Video): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbg27oT8Z9M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbg27oT8Z9M</a><br />KEXP Live Performance: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p7K2pnmy00">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p7K2pnmy00</a><br /><br />Directed/Written/Shot/Edited by Pierce McGarry.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pmcgravy">https://www.youtube.com/user/pmcgravy</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.piercemcgarry.com/">http://www.piercemcgarry.com/</a><br /><br />This project is funded in part by FACTOR, the Government of Canada and Canada's private radio broadcasters.{% endraw %}
