{% raw %}Angus Clark: &quot;Ward Off is a bouncy, spring like energy that comes from within. It's really good to get the feel of this rather than experiencing it as something hard and solid that keeps something away. In fact it's quite the opposite -- in pushing hands ward off is the posture that you use to meet the other person's energy so you want it to be soft, sensitive and bouncy. Ward Off Right is not a mirror image of its predecessor. It uses a different shape. They're both ward off but slightly different expressions. A bit like ice-cream -- one's vanilla, one's strawberry!&quot;<br /><br />More information at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.livingmovement.com/publications.html">http://www.livingmovement.com/publications.html</a><br />Write to Angus at angus@livingmovement.com{% endraw %}
