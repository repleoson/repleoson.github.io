{% raw %}Making 2,163 Potions To Kill This Entire Minecraft Server... This was insane!<br /><br />What if there was a Minecraft Server where you could steal someone's hearts by ending them. <br /><br />In this minecraft video, I brewed 2,163 Potions to kill everyone in survival minecraft. I did this on the Lifesteal SMP, also known as the deadliest minecraft server to exist, and it was super intense. I built this redstone mech to kill ClownPierce, PrinceZam, Leowook, and Midmysticx. This server also contains people like Parrot (also known as ParrotX2 or zParrot) and Spoke (also known as SpokeIsHere). This is similar to Parrot or ParrotX2 on the school SMP series where he started a war or ended a war or when Spoke Created 1000+ Iron Golems To Kill 1 Player in Survival Minecraft.<br /><br />Other Lifesteal Creators:<br />@Parrot @Spoke @ClownPierce @PrinceZam @Leowook @Midmysticx <br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClgolMrKuXABFC9H4DxlSCw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClgolMrKuXABFC9H4DxlSCw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />Twitter: twitter.com/roshambogames<br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://discord.gg/mtE3J6J">http://discord.gg/mtE3J6J</a><br /><br />Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or <br />Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that.
