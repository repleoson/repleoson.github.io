AI generated portraits may not be historically accurate.<br /><br />Portrait of a beautiful Kurdish lady known as Kchi Kafrosh (The daughter of a haymaker) by people of Kurdistan. Apparently, Kafrosh is the name of her tribe or village which was located in Koya District in Iraqi Kurdistan Region. Here real name (unconfirmed) was Khadeeja Jomaa Mawlood Shikak. When Britain invaded Iraq in 1934, one of the high-ranking British officers saw this lady's beauty and sought her hand multiple times. When her father declined, the British officer kidnapped her and flew her to Britain. According to unconfirmed reports, she jumped herself from the plane and perished. Since then, Kchi Kafrosh has become a legend and a fairytale that has been passed down from generation to generation, a narrative to be told in perpetuity. Another version of the story claims that a British officer built a castle for her and bejewelled her as promised, and that she spent her life away from her father and brother. For Kurds, the drawing of Kchi Kafrosh, the beautiful Kurdish lady, is as significant as the Mona Lisa is for Europeans. Her photo was hung on the walls of practically every Kurdish home. For Kurdish people, she was a symbol of beauty. To the rest of the world she remained the unknown Mona Lisa. Many artists have redrawn the portrait in numerous forms since then. There is also a Kurdish film by Tanya Karem with the same name &quot;Kchi Kafrosh&quot; that tells her story.<br /><br />Check out more Mystery Scoop Shorts here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuCx3d-8mGB2H8At3hnfm9rtFIhwWPipu">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuCx3d-8mGB2H8At3hnfm9rtFIhwWPipu</a><br /><br />Historical Figures Brought To Life:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuCx3d-8mGB3byEL1Q01jMa06cEoKovST">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuCx3d-8mGB3byEL1Q01jMa06cEoKovST</a><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />If you have enjoyed the video, please show some love by LIKING, COMMENTING and SUBSCRIBING to my channel!<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />#MysteryScoop #KchiKafrosh #Kurdish #Kurdistan #MonaLisa #HistoricalFigures #Historical #BroughtToLife #AIAnimation #Shorts #AI<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />For any Copyright issues, please reach out to us first before filing a claim with YouTube.
