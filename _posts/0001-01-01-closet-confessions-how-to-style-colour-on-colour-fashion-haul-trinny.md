{% raw %}Join Trinny Woodall for this Closet Confessions focussing on the brilliance of dressing with colour. Colour is one of the greatest parts of clothing as it has the power to uplift, excite and add character and feeling to any outfit, but for some people, it can be the scariest addition to an outfit and a leap into the unknown. Trinny debunks the myths around what you can and can’t wear… <br /><br />See inside Trinny Woodall’s impressive and expansive wardrobe with Closet Confessions. In each episode, Trinny deep-dives into a particular section of her wardrobe with the help of Lucy from the Trinny London team. Everything you wanted to know about styling, clothing, fashion and even how to organise your wardrobe can be found in this series. From coats to sequins, jewellery to vintage pieces, take some Trinny tips on your tour through Trinny’s (fifteen) wardrobes.<br /><br />For more Closet Confessions from Trinny, head to the T-Time blog here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/closet-confessions-blog-colour">http://bit.ly/closet-confessions-blog-colour</a>{% endraw %}
