If you look at the statistics, you might feel terrified. <br />- Sharks cause just six deaths a year - their infamous reputation is very exaggerated. <br />- Wolves are responsible for ten deaths annually.<br />- Lions kill 22 people a year.<br />- Now get ready: elephants, cute lovely giants, are the reason that more than 500 people lose their lives every year!<br />- Hippopotamuses equal them in this scary competition.<br />- Crocodiles turn out to be much more dangerous than sharks: about one thousand deaths a year.<br />- But the champion here is the snake: 100,000 people meet their end at the teeth of this reptile.<br /><br />We hope you will never have to escape from a rhinoceros, swim away from a crocodile, or meet a hungry lion. However, now you will be able to protect yourself in the wilderness. <br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br /><br />SMART Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/JTfP6L">https://goo.gl/JTfP6L</a><br /><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
