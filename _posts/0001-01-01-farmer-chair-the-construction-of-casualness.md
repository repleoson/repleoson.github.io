{% raw %}8 pieces of wood, 4 square rods, 2 fabric panels. All built strictly at right angles. The fabric panels are laid crosswise. 2 metal clamps. Done. The first phenomenon is that such minimalist components when put together produce such a laid-back piece of furniture. The second is that it looks as if it has just been created. Designer Gerd Lange came up with the identical predecessor of the Farmer chair back in 1965. While the seating furniture used to adorn mainly the patios of artistic bohemians, today it can be used everywhere. Whether in the waiting area of a young start-up company, in a private living room or outdoors. Incidentally, this is not because Farmer adapts to its surroundings – on the contrary, the surroundings complement Farmer the way a gallery complements a work of art.{% endraw %}
