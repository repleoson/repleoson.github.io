{% raw %}Hello, and welcome to my channel. This is a space for study enthusiasts and tea drinkers, and those who spend hours ambling around libraries and book shops. I hope that my videos can provide motivation and encourage you to be productive, but without feeding into Hustle Culture. I think that productivity is all about enjoying what we do, and finding time for things that bring us happiness or will bring us happiness in the future -- and I hope to celebrate this kind of living on my channel.<br /><br />MY OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS:<br />✉️ Business Enquiries: rubygranger@sixteenth.co<br />😊 Instagram - @_rubygranger<br />📚 Goodreads: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2JKD4nM">http://bit.ly/2JKD4nM</a> (see what I'm reading!)<br />📖 The RubyReads Book Club (facebook): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2647435375528444">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2647435375528444</a> <br />📖 The RubyReads Book Club (Discord): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/b4gzugKE">https://discord.gg/b4gzugKE</a><br /><br />PUMPKIN PRODUCTIVITY (MY STATIONERY SHOP):<br />📒 The Yearly Planner (pdf download): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3sMA25s">https://bit.ly/3sMA25s</a><br />💕 CanBeKind Charity Pin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3wk5eej">https://bit.ly/3wk5eej</a><br />🎀 The Kindness Journal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3sEolNY">https://bit.ly/3sEolNY</a><br />💻 Digital Study Planners (£1 each): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Pj9IBv">https://bit.ly/2Pj9IBv</a><br />📙Master To Do List: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Oc6X47">https://bit.ly/2Oc6X47</a><br />📘Daily Study Planner: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3sI9pOX">https://bit.ly/3sI9pOX</a><br /><br />MY BOOK: ‘Erimentha Parker’s To Do List’ is a middle-grade book about bullying. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3mdJKLm">https://amzn.to/3mdJKLm</a><br /><br />FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:<br />😇 How old are you? 21.<br />📝 What are you studying?
