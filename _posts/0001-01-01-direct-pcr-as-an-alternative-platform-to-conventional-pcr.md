{% raw %}Viral RNA detection through RT-PCR is WHOâ€™s recommended confirmatory test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, many countries faced challenges in ramping up RT-PCR testing capacity, such as shortage of swab sticks, transport media, RNA extraction reagents and costly platform equipment. The testing demands have led to the development of alternative PCR protocols with similar sensitivities to relieve the testing load. In this webinar, we discuss how using direct PCR test can manage COVID-19 testing demands.<br /><br />Chair and Moderator:<br />Dr Benedict Yan - Pathologist and Director of Molecular Diagnostics Centre, National University Health Systems, Singapore<br /><br />Speakers and Panelists:<br />1.
