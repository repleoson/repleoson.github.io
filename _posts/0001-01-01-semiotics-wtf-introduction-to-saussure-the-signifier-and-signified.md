{% raw %}In this episode of What the Theory, an introduction to semiotics, in particular the approaches of linguists and semioticians Ferdinand de Saussure and Charles Sanders Peirce.<br /><br />Signs, semiotics as well as the concepts of the signifier and signified can seem like somewhat complex terminology when first starting out as can Peirce's related yet distinct notion of the icon, index, symbol triad. In this video essay, I try to help all you out who would like semiotics explained in a clear and concise manner so that you can go away with a slightly clearer understanding of semiotics theory.<br /><br />Further Reading<br /><br />Semiotics: A Graphic Guide by Paul Cobley &amp; Litza Jansz<br />US: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SCGokF">https://amzn.to/2SCGokF</a><br />UK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SB84GX">https://amzn.to/2SB84GX</a><br /><br />Semiotics: The Basics by Daniel Chandler<br />US: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2EFeEbJ">https://amzn.to/2EFeEbJ</a><br />UK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2VpgP8C">https://amzn.to/2VpgP8C</a><br /><br />Mythologies by Roland Barthes<br />US: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Eq3rud">https://amzn.to/2Eq3rud</a><br />UK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2NBvXNu">https://amzn.to/2NBvXNu</a><br /><br />[The above are affiliate links.
