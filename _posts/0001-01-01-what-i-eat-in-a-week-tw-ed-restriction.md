{% raw %}hi everyone! I just wanted to say a few quick things, especially as eating disorders are quite a touchy subject.<br /><br />1. I am strictly pro-recovery and not pro-ana! Please heed the trigger warning if watching videos of food restriction is harmful to you! I also want to emphasise the fact that you should NOT try and mimic my eating behaviours or take this video as 'advice' or 'tips' to follow. That's not the purpose of this video or this channel. I just want to bring some awareness to what living with an eating disorder is like, and connect with other people that have similar issues, as well as using this as a diary of sorts so I can reflect on my own actions. I watch a lot of videos similar to this and they comfort me a lot so I just wanted to give it a go!<br /><br />2. I'm not trying to glorify or romanticise eating disorders in any way. I'm more than aware that this isn't a sustainable method of weightloss and is not healthy, and I'd like everyone watching to be aware of that too. In a lot of ways, anorexia has ruined my life, so I'd encourage anyone suffering to seek help and anyone that isn't to try your best not to fall into unhealthy habits!<br /><br />3. I do normally eat more than this, I had an extremely low calorie week, which I wasn't expecting. Normally after a binge I'm more hungry than usual!<br /><br />4. I have â€˜recoveredâ€™ from my ed before (I say that in quotes bc it clearly wasnâ€™t a full recovery) and relapsed about a year ago. I am currently seeing a psychologist about it to try and recover again, and my family are aware of my ed, however recovery is a long and hard process that is filled with a lot of pitfalls and setbacks. Trust me, I am not idolising my disorder and as much as your comments are well intended, I donâ€™t need 50 people telling me that this is unhealthy and I need to get help. Please take this into consideration when commenting ðŸ’•<br /><br />Thank you so much for watching and being understanding!{% endraw %}
