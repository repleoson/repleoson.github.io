𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗯𝗲𝗹𝗼𝘄 ⤵<br />First off, thanks so much for giving these playlists a listen! Aside from the playlists, I run a small record club that features postcards that double as vinyl singles that play on turntables. Each month, we mail out a vinyl postcard along with handwritten messages from our favorite artists. It starts at only $4/mo. + postage. I'd love for you to be a part of it! Each release comes with a digital download and the art / handwritten notes from artists makes for great collectibles even if you don't have a turntable. You can see how they work / find more details at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.vinylpost.co">http://www.vinylpost.co</a><br />𝘗𝘴𝘴𝘴𝘵... 𝘶𝘴𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘤𝘰𝘥𝘦 &quot;𝘗𝘌𝘕𝘗𝘈𝘓&quot; 𝘵𝘰 𝘵𝘳𝘺 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘧𝘪𝘳𝘴𝘵 𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵 $2. 😉<br /><br />Otherwise, feel free to join our Patreon which will give you access to Spotify / Apple music versions of all the playlists I share on here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/indieplaylists">https://www.patreon.com/indieplaylists</a><br />𝗧𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗸 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘀𝗼 𝗺𝘂𝗰𝗵! <br />------<br /><br />Tracklist:<br />[00:00] Elephant Castle - Cool To Be Unhappy<br />[04:25] Mild High Club - Homage<br />[07:22] Kainalu - Kamikaze Mushroom Palace<br />[11:54] Metronomy - The Light<br />[16:27] Unknown Mortal Orchestra - Hunnybee<br />[20:55] The Holydrug Couple - If I Could Find You (Eternity)<br />[23:56] Boogarins - Foimal<br />[27:08] Purr - Bad Advice<br />[30:25] Vanishing Twin - Magician's Success<br />[34:21] Sunbeam Sound Machine - In Your Arms<br />[39:00] Sugar Candy Mountain - Windows<br />[42:12] Flamingods - Olympia<br />[45:45] Ceramic Animal - Dreams Via Memories<br />[50:37] Kainalu - Older Than I Am<br />[55:31] The Undercover Dream Lovers - I Don't Know Your Name<br />[59:52] No Fun Haus - To Be Alone<br />[1:03:34] Moses Gunn Collective - Shalala<br />[1:07:22] Spaceface - Cowboy Lightning<br />[1:09:56] Crumb - Locket<br />[1:15:14] Black Moth Super Rainbow - Like a Sundae<br />[1:19:28] Slow Pulp - Preoccupied<br />[1:22:48] Beach Fossils - Sleep Apnea<br />[1:25:14] Allah-Las - Catamaran<br />[1:28:47] The Lazy Eyes - Where's My Brain???

Featuring the tracks Lost In Yesterday, Borderline &amp; It Might Be Time. The Slow Rush was recorded between Los Angeles and Parker’s studio in his hometown of Fremantle, Australia. The twelve tracks were written, recorded, produced and mixed by Parker. The Slow Rush is Parker’s deep dive into the oceans of time, conjuring the feeling of a lifetime in a lightning bolt, of major milestones whizzing by while you’re looking at your phone, it’s a paean to creation and destruction and the unending cycle of life. In support of The Slow Rush, Tame Impala will tour across North America, Australia &amp; New Zealand, and the UK in the coming months. Thanks to the ravenous demand of fans for a transcendent live performance, Tame Impala has headlined festivals and theatres around the world and released three full length albums - Innerspeaker, Lonerism and Currents. As a writer and producer Parker has collaborated with Travis Scott, SZA, Lady Gaga, Mark Ronson, Kanye West, Kali Uchis, Theophilus London, Miguel, A$AP Rocky and more.<br /><br />Music Like Tame Impala | Similar Artists Playlist<br />#tameimpala #similarartists #indie<br /><br />Best of Playlists<br />Indie / Bedroom Pop / lofi / Dreampop / Electronic / Surf Rock<br /><br />Enjoy the uploads?
