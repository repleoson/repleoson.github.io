Embarking on a pioneering venture through the realms of House, Disco and their associated sub-genres; DEMOU is rapidly rising up through the Dance ranks with releases already on respected labels, Under No Illusion, Reptile Dysfunction, Four Thirty Two and Superfett. ‘Sing Your Praises’ is a straight up, no nonsense House hit, oozing lush piano melodies, warming hypnotic vocals, hip-swinging House drums and intricate percussion married perfectly with a pulsating low-end and powerful melodic bass hook. Shermanology complete the package, delivering a Techier take on the original, adding their own raw, authentic sound to the track with playful bassline, exciting synth hooks that grow with subtle melodic hints, percolating rhythms and robust drums. <br /> <br />Nothing Else Matters (NEM) channels the inclusive energy dance music is truly about.
