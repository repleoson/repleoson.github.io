/><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />I walked through the door with you <br />The air was cold <br />But somethin bout it felt like home somehow <br />And I left my scarf there at your sister’s house <br />And you’ve still got it in your drawer even now <br />Oh your sweet disposition, and my wide eyed gaze <br />We’re singing in the car getting lost upstate<br />Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place <br />And I can picture it after all these days <br />And I know it’s long gone and that magic’s not here no more <br />And I might be ok but I’m not fine at all…<br /><br />Cause there we are again on that <br />Little town street <br />You almost ran the red <br />Cause you were looking over at me <br />Wind in my hair, I was there <br />I remember it all too well<br /><br />Photo album on the counter <br />Your cheeks were turning red<br />You used to be a little kid with glasses<br />in a twin-sized bed <br />And your mother’s telling stories bout you on <br />the tee ball team <br />You taught me bout your past <br />Thinkin your future was me<br />And you were tossing me the car keys <br />‘F*** the patriarchy’ keychain on the ground<br />We were always skipping town<br />And I was thinking on the drive down<br />Any time now, he’s gonna say it’s love<br />You never called it what it was<br />til we were dead and gone and buried <br />Check the pulse and come back <br />Swearing it’s the same, after 3 months in the grave<br />And then you wondered where it went to<br />As I reached for you but<br />All I felt was shame<br />And you held my lifeless frame <br />And I know it’s long gone and <br />There was nothing else I could do <br />And I forget about you long enough<br />To forget why I needed to… <br /><br />Cause there we are again in the middle of the night<br />We’re dancin round the kitchen in the <br />refrigerator light<br />Down the stairs, I was there<br />I remember it all too well…<br />And there we are again <br />When nobody had to know<br />You kept me like a secret<br />But I kept you like an oath<br />Sacred prayer and we’d swear <br />to remember it all too well <br /><br />Well maybe we got lost in translation <br />Maybe I asked for too much<br />But maybe this thing was a masterpiece<br />Til you tore it all up<br />Running scared, I was there<br />I remember it all too well<br />And you call me up again <br />Just to break me like a promise <br />So casually cruel in the name of being honest <br />I’m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here<br />Cause I remember it all, all, all <br />They say all’s well that ends well<br />But I’m in a new hell every time<br />You double-cross my mind<br />You said if we had been closer in age<br />Maybe it would have been fine<br />And that made me want to die.<br /><br />The idea you had of me<br />Who was she?<br />A never-needy, ever lovely jewel<br />Whose shine reflects on you<br />Not weeping in a party bathroom<br />Some actress asking me what happened<br />You.<br />That’s what happened: You.<br />You, who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes<br />Sipping coffee like you were on a late night show<br />But then he watched me watch the front door <br />all night, willing you to come<br />And he said, “it’s supposed to be fun… <br />Turning 21” <br /><br />Time won’t fly<br />It’s like I’m paralyzed by it <br />I’d like to be my old self again<br />But I’m still trying to find it <br />After plaid shirt days <br />And nights when you made me your own<br />Now you mail back my things <br />And I walk home alone<br />But you keep my old scarf<br />From that very first week<br />Cause it reminds you of innocence, and it smells like me <br />You can’t get rid of it<br />Cause you remember it all too well<br /><br />Cause there we are again when<br />I loved you so <br />Back before you lost the one real thing<br />You’ve ever known<br />It was rare, I was there<br />I remember it all too well<br />Wind in my hair, you were there <br />You remember it all <br />Down the stairs, you were there <br />You remember it all<br />It was rare, I was there<br />I remember it all too well<br /><br />And I was never good at telling jokes <br />But the punchline goes:<br />“I’ll get older, but your lovers stay my age”<br />From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones<br />I’m a soldier who’s returning half her weight<br />And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?<br />Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?<br />Cause in this city’s barren cold<br />I still remember the first fall of snow<br />And how it glistened as it fell<br />I remember it all too well<br /><br />Just between us did the love affair maim you <br />All too well<br />Just between us, do you remember it <br />All too well<br />Just between us, I remember it all too well<br /><br />Wind in my hair <br />I was there, I was there<br />Down the stairs, I was there<br />I was there<br />Sacred prayer<br />I was there, I was there<br />It was rare, you remember it<br />All too well  <br /><br />#taylorswift #alltoowell #sadgirlautumn{% endraw %}
