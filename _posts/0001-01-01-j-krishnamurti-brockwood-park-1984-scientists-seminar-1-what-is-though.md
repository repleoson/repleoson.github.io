{% raw %}J. Krishnamurti - Brockwood Park 1984 - Scientists Seminar 1 - What is thought?<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Can one observe the structure and nature of the brain in oneself, rather than externally?<br /><br />Is it necessary to have a theory or model to see what is actually going on?<br /><br />Why do we divide the brain at all?<br /><br />What is thought? What is thinking?<br /><br />The observer is the past, memory, knowledge, experience. Can I look at something without the past?<br /><br />Psychologically, why should I accumulate? <br /><br />If action is 'I will do' or 'I have done', it is not action. Action is now. <br /><br />When the observer is the observed there is a radical change in the brain.<br /><br />To change a physical habit is fairly simple but a psychological habit demands much greater energy. <br /><br />I have an insight that going north is futile, and the insight says go east, and I move. There is no interval in this movement.<br /><br />---<br /><br />This channel is managed by the Krishnamurti Foundation Trust​​, UK​, and by the Krishnamurti Foundation of America.<br /><br />The role of the foundations was described by Krishnamurti when he said,​ ​'The foundations will see to it that these teachings are kept whole, are not distorted, are not made corrupt. They will not give rise to any sectarian spirit in their activities... nor create any kind of place of worship around the teachings or the person.​'​<br /><br />We maintain extensive archives of Krishnamurti's original works and all four Krishnamurti foundations are actively engaged in the publication of material in various forms.<br /><br />Our videos contain thousands of subtitles in more than 25 languages, translated by volunteers from all over the world. If you would like to help us with translating subtitles, please contact us at digital@kfoundation.org<br /><br />For more information about J.
