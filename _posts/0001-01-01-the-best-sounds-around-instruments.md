{% raw %}The Best Sounds Around (Instruments)<br /><br />Learn the sounds that musical instruments make with this original song from Nick. Children can make the association between what an instrument looks like and the sound it makes. We've also put in a short pause before each sound is revealed to give the little ones chance to shout out the name of the instrument. Enjoy.<br /><br />Our website www.nurserytracks.com has the lyrics for each song, as well as FREE coloring pictures.<br /><br />Copyright information: Words and music copyright Nick Hall. Arrangement Nick Hall.{% endraw %}
