{% raw %}Tucker Carlson is joined by Naomi Wolf on @Fox Nation giving an ahistorical account of the AIDS epidemic, stating that unlike Covid it was not moralized or politicized. Tucker agrees with Wolf on how the United States can’t &quot;just get through it&quot; and stop blaming individuals. The Majority Report crew discuss how the Right continues to lie through the Covid pandemic and put the blame on 'authoritarianism'. <br /><br />We stream our live show every day at 12 PM ET.<br /><br /><br /><br />We need your help to keep providing free videos!

She had multiple sort of like scandals about her academic work and is now like a full-on anti-vaxxer.<br /><br />Emma Vigeland: And just to talk a little just quickly touch on anxiety related to anti-vaxxers, If you're like maybe having that kind of extreme anxiety about a fascist state that doesn't seem proportional to reality like you can understand some of the underlying I think ways this conversation is pushed forward...{% endraw %}
