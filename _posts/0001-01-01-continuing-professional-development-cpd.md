{% raw %}Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is how professionally registered engineers demonstrate that they are enhancing their competence. Carrying out CPD needn’t be a chore and any learning that relates to the five groups in UK-SPEC is valuable – the type of learning and how to record CPD is up to the individual. By committing to CPD, professionally registered engineers are assuring the public of their competence. Professional engineering institutions sample the CPD records of their registered members to demonstrate this commitment and anyone who doesn’t engage with CPD sampling could be at risk of losing their professional title. <br /><br />Watch this animation to find out more about CPD for professional registered engineers, or visit www.engc.org.uk/cpd{% endraw %}
