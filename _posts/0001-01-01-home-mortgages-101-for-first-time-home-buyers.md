{% raw %}This video is the ULTIMATE GUIDE to home mortgages.<br /><br />A mortgage is one of the biggest and longest-term loans that a household will ever take on, so it makes sense to understand it inside and out.<br /><br />In this video we will talk about:<br />1. The 4 factors that make up a home mortgage<br />2. The 7 different types of mortgages<br />3. A live demo through my home affordability spreadsheet<br />4. A live example of an amortization table (15 years vs 30 years)<br /><br />It's important to understand everything that goes into a home mortgage. It is also important to understand how adjusting the loan amount, term, and interest can affect the amount of money you pay overall.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, this video is a great resource for learning about mortgages as a beginner or first time home buyer!<br /><br />Enjoy, and please share this video on social media with a friend!<br /><br />GET MY HOME AFFORDABILITY SPREADSHEET HERE:<br />üè† <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/whiteboardfinance">https://www.patreon.com/whiteboardfinance</a><br /><br />WBF UNIVERSITY - JOIN MY SCHOOL HERE<br />‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com/wbf-university-waitlist">https://whiteboardfinance.com/wbf-university-waitlist</a><br /><br />LIMITED TIME - Get 1 FREE STOCK ON ROBINHOOD<br />‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/robinhood">https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/robinhood</a><br /><br />FUNDRISE - INVEST IN REAL ESTATE FOR ONLY $500<br />‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/fundrise">https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/fundrise</a><br /><br />M1 FINANCE - INVEST FOR FREE (Yes, Really)<br />‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/m1-finance">https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/m1-finance</a><br /><br />My FREE M1 Finance Training Video<br />‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/m1-finance-training">https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/m1-finance-training</a><br /><br />My FREE Stock Market For Beginners Guide<br />‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/stockmarket4beginners">https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/stockmarket4beginners</a><br /><br />SCHEDULE A COACHING CALL WITH ME<br />‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/marko-coaching">https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/marko-coaching</a><br /><br />HOW TO BUY &amp; STORE BITCOIN<br />‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/bitcoin">https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/bitcoin</a><br /><br />THE BEST CREDIT CARDS TO USE RIGHT NOW<br />‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/best-credit-cards">https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/best-credit-cards</a><br /><br />CHECK OUT MY BLOG:<br />‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com">https://whiteboardfinance.com</a><br /><br />FOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM<br />‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/whiteboardfinance">https://www.instagram.com/whiteboardfinance</a><br /><br />Instrumental Produced By &quot;Chuki Beats&quot;<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CHUKImusic">https://www.youtube.com/user/CHUKImusic</a><br /><br />ABOUT ME üëá<br /><br />My mission is to provide my viewers with actionable content that enables them to create financial wealth.
