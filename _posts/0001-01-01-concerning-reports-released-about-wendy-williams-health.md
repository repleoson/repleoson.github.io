{% raw %}New reports state things are getting worse for daytime TV talk show host Wendy Williams.<br /><br />Allegedly, Wendy’s capability to walk has become diminished, and she’s restricted to using a wheelchair now, according to The Ricky Smiley Morning Show’s Toine The Don, also known as Antoine Edwards. Toine explained on Nov. 22 the shocking update on Wendy’s health: “It is being reported that the 57-year-old talk show host has completely lost all blood circulation in her legs and in her feet.” After Reports recently surfaced that claimed that talk show host Wendy Williams is now confined to a wheelchair and suffering from early signs of dementia. The reports initially surfaced on The Ricky Smiley Morning Show, with Toine The Don stating that Wendy's brother, Thomas Williams, Jr., told blogger Tasha K. <br /><br />Wendy's brother responded to the claims, telling The-Sun, &quot;We haven’t had any alerts like that and I haven’t seen anything like that or have had conversations with her that would lead me to believe that. We routinely go up and check on Wendy even though we’re all down here in Florida. I try to make it up there and my dad speaks with Wendy frequently. So no, we don’t have any concerns concerning her mental state. It’s all physical. I am trying to find out if she’s coming down for Thanksgiving. I mean- she’s normal like that.&quot;<br /><br />Earlier this month, Wendy addressed her health issues in a statement, where she said, &quot;I'm making progress but it's just one of those things that's taking longer than we expected. I'm a woman of a certain age, and I know enough to listen to my doctors and will return to my purple chair as soon as we all agree I'm ready.&quot;<br /><br />Click Here To Get Our New Merchandise <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/39KoHKT">http://bit.ly/39KoHKT</a><br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8LJ_d-SCuE9V7pEl8PvyaQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8LJ_d-SCuE9V7pEl8PvyaQ/join</a><br /><br />The Latest Hip Hop News, Viral Headlines, And Breaking stories.
