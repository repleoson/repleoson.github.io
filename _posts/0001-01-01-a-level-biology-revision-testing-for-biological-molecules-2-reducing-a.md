{% raw %}In this video, we look at how to test for reducing sugars and non-reducing sugars. First, I take you through what is meant by a reducing sugar and give you examples. I then explore the Benedict's test for reducing sugars and explain why this test is semi-quantitative. We then look at how to carry out the test for non-reducing sugars, looking at sample results and what they tell us.{% endraw %}
