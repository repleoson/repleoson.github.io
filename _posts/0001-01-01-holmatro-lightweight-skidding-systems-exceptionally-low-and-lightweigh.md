{% raw %}Holmatroâ€™s lightweight Skidding System is built of extremely lightweight components, so it can be easily carried, handled and positioned by one or two persons without the need for a forklift or the use of extra equipment. The maximum capacity of the system is 200 tons, assuming two skidding units are used. The total construction height is just 56 mm (2.20 inches). Despite its low height, a relatively large unsupported span is possible when the surface is uneven. The skidding capacity and control can be customized to client specifications.
