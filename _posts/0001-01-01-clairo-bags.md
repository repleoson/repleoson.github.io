{% raw %}My debut album 'Immunity' out now!!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://clairo.lnk.to/immunity">http://clairo.lnk.to/immunity</a><br /><br />Purchase a ticket to the Immunity Tour!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.clairo.com/tour">https://www.clairo.com/tour</a><br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Every second counts,<br />I don’t want to talk to you anymore<br />All these little games<br />you can call me by the name I gave you yesterday<br /><br />Every minute counts,<br />I don’t want to watch TV anymore<br />Can you figure me out?<br />Just doin this to waste more time on the couch<br /><br />Can you see me I’m waiting for the right time<br />I can’t read you but if you want, the pleasure’s all mine<br />Can you see me using everything to hold back<br />I guess this could be worse<br />Walking out the door with your bags<br />x4<br /><br />[Instrumental]<br /><br />Pour your glass of wine<br />Mitchell told me I should be just fine<br />Cases under the bed<br />Spill it open let it rush to my head<br /><br />I don’t want to be forward<br />I don’t want to cut corners<br />savor this with everything I have inside me<br />I’m not the type to run<br />I know that we’re having fun<br />But what’s the rush? Kissing and my cheeks are so flushed<br /><br />Tell you how i felt<br />Sugar coated melting in your mouth<br />Pardon my emotions, I should probably keep it all to myself<br />Know you’d make fun of me<br />x4<br /><br />Chorus{% endraw %}
