{% raw %}Hello everyone! <br /><br />This song was requested quite a lot, it was one of my favorite songs to dance to when I was little! This song is one that I hold dear to me.<br /><br />I've found myself listening to a lot of nostalgic and upbeat music recently, and I hope this helps liven your spirits a bit if you're feeling a little blue.<br /><br />&quot;Sh-Boom&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;Life Could Be a Dream&quot;) is an early doo-wop song by The Chords. It was written by James Keyes, Claude Feaster, Carl Feaster, Floyd F. McRae, and William Edwards, members of the R&amp;B vocal group the Chords, and published in 1954.<br /><br />My Patreon:<br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/allisonyoungmusic?fan_landing=true">https://www.patreon.com/allisonyoungmusic?fan_landing=true</a><br /><br />My instruments:<br />-Jasmine by Takamine classical guitar<br />-Ludwig Snare<br /><br />Mic details:<br />-Vox: Vintage 1935 RCA 74B <br />- Guitar and Snare: Shure Vintage 545S Series 2 Unidyne III Microphone<br /><br />Video Details: <br />-Shot on my iPhone and edited with VideoLeap<br /><br />Mix: <br />-By me on Garageband<br /><br />End song credits:<br />George Street Shuffle by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1300035">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1300035</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a><br />______________________________________<br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br />Find me elsewhere:<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/allisonyoung.xo/">https://www.instagram.com/allisonyoung.xo/</a><br />Bandcamp: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://allisonyoung.bandcamp.com/">https://allisonyoung.bandcamp.com/</a><br />You can find my original music on all streaming platforms!<br /><br />~Virtual Tip Jar:<br />PayPal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/allisonnlovess">https://www.paypal.me/allisonnlovess</a><br />Venmo: @allisonnlovess<br /><br />Wishing you health and happiness,<br />Xo{% endraw %}
