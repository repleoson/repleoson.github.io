{% raw %}Text fields in Power BI are sorted alphabetically by default. What if this ordering doesn’t make logical sense of how you want to display the data?  This is where you can use the Sort By Column feature in the program.  I use this every time I want to sort the names of my months in chronological order rather than alphabetical. But what if… you don’t have a column that has numbers the define your sort order? Well, in this video I will show you how to add that column in using DAX and the tricky workaround you will need for proper execution. There are multiple ways of solving this scenario, but I always love showing some DAX functions for those new to learning Power BI. 😉<br /><br />👍 If you enjoy this video and are interested in formal training on Power BI, Power Apps, Azure, or other Microsoft products you can use my code &quot;Matt20&quot; at check out when purchasing our On-Demand Learning classes to get extra 20% off - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pragmaticworks.com/pricing/">https://pragmaticworks.com/pricing/</a><br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />Next step on your journey: <br />👉 On-Demand Learning Courses Free Trial: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pragmaticworkstraining.com/on-demand-learning-free-trial/">https://www.pragmaticworkstraining.com/on-demand-learning-free-trial/</a><br /><br />🔗Pragmatic Works On-Demand Learning Packages: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pragmaticworks.com/pricing/">https://pragmaticworks.com/pricing/</a><br />🔗Pragmatic Works Boot Camps: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pragmaticworks.com/boot-camps/">https://pragmaticworks.com/boot-camps/</a><br />🔗Pragmatic Works Hackathons: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pragmaticworks.com/private-training/hackathons/">https://pragmaticworks.com/private-training/hackathons/</a> <br />🔗Pragmatic Works Virtual Mentoring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pragmaticworks.com/virtual-mentoring/">https://pragmaticworks.com/virtual-mentoring/</a><br />🔗Pragmatic Works Enterprise Private Training: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pragmaticworks.com/private-training/customized-enterprise-training/">https://pragmaticworks.com/private-training/customized-enterprise-training/</a><br />🔗Pragmatic Works Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://blog.pragmaticworks.com/">http://blog.pragmaticworks.com/</a> <br /> <br />Let's connect: <br />✔️Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/PragmaticWorks">https://twitter.com/PragmaticWorks</a> <br />✔️Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pragmaticworks/">https://www.facebook.com/pragmaticworks/</a> <br />✔️Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/pragmatic.works">https://www.instagram.com/pragmatic.works</a> <br />✔️LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pragmaticworks">https://www.linkedin.com/company/pragmaticworks</a> <br />✔️YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/pragmaticworks">https://www.youtube.com/pragmaticworks</a> <br /> <br />Pragmatic Works<br />7175 Hwy 17, Suite 2 Fleming Island, FL  32003<br />Phone: (904) 413-1911<br />Email: training@pragmaticworks.com{% endraw %}
