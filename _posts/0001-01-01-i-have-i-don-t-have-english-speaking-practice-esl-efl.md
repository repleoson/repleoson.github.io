In the second have of this video, you will practice speaking English on your own.<br /><br />Language in use:<br />I have a tennis racket but I don't have tennis balls.<br />I have a bat but I don't have a baseball.<br />I have paper but I don't have a pencil.<br />I have my books but I don't have my lunch.<br />I have my drink but I don't have my sandwich.<br />I have a red dress but I don't have a yellow one.<br />I have a dog but I don't have a cat.<br />I have a daughter but I don't have a son.<br /><br /><br />This video is designed for students, teachers and anyone wanting to learn English. <br /><br />My videos are vocabulary-based for conversation practice. Each video is themed to provide context for learning. To insure success, every video is designed with open slots for vocabulary substitution practice. These patterns allow students to practice on their own and teachers can have their class practice together as a group.  <br /><br />These videos also work great for icebreakers and class discussions.<br /><br />Please have fun and speak English now!<br /><br />Thank you for your kind support :)<br /><br />Mark Kulek<br /><br />Here are my T-Shirts / Coffee Mug:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.spreadshirt.com/100051466?noCache=true">https://shop.spreadshirt.com/100051466?noCache=true</a><br /><br />Here are my Conversation Cards:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.englishbooks.jp/catalog/index.php/MSC-Press-m-147">http://www.englishbooks.jp/catalog/index.php/MSC-Press-m-147</a><br /><br />Here are my ebooks:<br /><br />25 Short Simple Conversations Volume One:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MT6OZ54">http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MT6OZ54</a>   <br /><br />25 Short Simple Conversations Volume Two:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B014MN7ESQ">http://www.amazon.com/dp/B014MN7ESQ</a><br /><br />For those of you who are interested in teaching English to young learners.
