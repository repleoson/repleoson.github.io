{% raw %}Yves quit his job even though he had it all: a big salary, health benefits and a pension plan.  He sold his downtown condo, too.  Why did he decide to drastically simplify his life?  Because he was unhappy and unfulfilled.  A couple of years ago, he went on a 10-day silent retreat and, after much soul-searching, realized that his job and his stressful lifestyle needed to go.  Now, a year and a half later, he's living a minimalist lifestyle in a small bachelor apartment, riding his bike to work, and working 3 days a week at a grocery store.  He has more time to spend with the people he loves, and a lot less stress.  Does he regret his downshifting decision?
