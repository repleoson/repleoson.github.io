In these videos I am talking you through the more technical side of wedding photography, my set up and camera settings.<br /><br />However I don't think that it is the technical side of photography which holds most of us back from being the best wedding photographers that we can often. Often the things which are hold us back the most are to do with mindset and self belief.<br /><br />In this video I talk about five beliefs which I feel can hold us back from being the best wedding photographers that we can be. These include embracing failure, not worrying about what other wedding photographers think of you, not believing all that you see on social media and knowing that having the most expensive camera won't make you a better photographer.<br /><br />If you would like to attend one of my future wedding photography workshops, please sign up to my mailing list here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.neilredfern.com/off-camera-flash-workshop/">https://www.neilredfern.com/off-camera-flash-workshop/</a><br /><br />For more details about my work, please visit my website or follow me on Instagram :-)<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.neilredfern.com/">https://www.neilredfern.com/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/neilredfern/">https://www.instagram.com/neilredfern/</a><br /><br />#weddingphotography{% endraw %}
