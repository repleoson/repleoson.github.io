Jonna told Truly: “I’m only 3 feet and typically (people with) other types of dwarfism are a lot taller than me. I look average size, just smooshed together!” High school was the hardest for Jonna as kids were having crushes but no-one wanted to date a ‘little person’. She said: &quot;Dating with dwarfism is very different. Dating someone that has something physically different about them, you’re learning to understand and there’s a lot of questions to be asked!” Jonna has never been on a blind date and doesn’t have many expectations. “The only expectation I have is that he’s nice and that it goes well!  As I get older I realize that if someone that's genuine and honest and loyal is like a huge checklist!” Will Jonna's blind date - 6ft 1'' Brian - be the guy of her dreams?<br /><br />Follow Jonna and Brian:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lilmissross7/">https://www.instagram.com/lilmissross7/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/briancade1/">https://www.instagram.com/briancade1/</a><br /><br />Videographer: Matt Mealer, Joe Roberts<br />Producers: Dav Rich and Ruby Coote<br />Editor: Paul Zeller<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
