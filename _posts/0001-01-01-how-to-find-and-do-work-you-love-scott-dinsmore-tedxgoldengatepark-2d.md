{% raw %}Scott Dinsmore's mission is to change the world by helping people find what excites them and build a career around the work only they are capable of doing. He is a career change strategist whose demoralizing experience at a Fortune 500 job launched his quest to understand why 80% of adults hate the work they do, and more importantly, to identify what the other 20% were doing differently. His research led to experiences with thousands of employees and entrepreneurs from 158 countries. Scott distilled the results down to his Passionate Work Framework - three surprisingly simple practices for finding and doing work you love, that all happen to be completely within our control. He makes his career tools available free to the public through his community at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://LiveYourLegend.net">http://LiveYourLegend.net</a><br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)<br /><br />This talk was shot shot and edited in stereoscopic 3D by Golden Gate 3D and Area 5.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://gg3d.com">http://gg3d.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://area5.tv">http://area5.tv</a><br /><br />To view in 3D, click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/5o1nCKGk5Bs">http://youtu.be/5o1nCKGk5Bs</a>{% endraw %}
