Without you babe.<br /><br />Now everything I do, is all for loving you.<br />Its not something that we're used to.<br />No other way to say, I need you everyday.<br />And now I'm gonna change my ways.<br />And it's a part of you, I never wanna lose.<br />I'll do anything you want me to.<br />Like any other day, I know I'll find a way-aa-aay.<br />And if ever I'm alone you'll say.<br /><br />I'll be thinking about you.<br />I'll be thinking about you.<br />I'll be thinking about you.<br />I'll be thinking about you.<br />I'll be thinking about you.<br />I'll be thinking about you.<br />I'll be thinking about you.<br />I'll be thinking about you.{% endraw %}
