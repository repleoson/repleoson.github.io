Old Dominion)<br /><br />[Verse 1: Caitlyn Smith]<br />This ain't a twenty minute town no more<br />It don't look the same<br />Red lights, bars, streets, too much concrete<br />I don't recognize a thing<br />Ain't a twenty minute call no more<br />No, you don't call me at all<br />Outside, a rain falls, curtains half drawn<br />I'm here, talking to the walls<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />All the time and the whiskey I've wasted<br />That I ain't ever getting back<br />And I've tried to find the courage just to face it<br />But I can't, I can't<br />And I'm tired of you feeling like a stranger<br />Over and over again<br />Oh, when everything around me keeps changing<br />But I can't, I can't, I can't<br /><br />[Verse 2: Old Dominion &amp; Caitlyn Smith]<br />It feels impossible to move sometimes<br />Like you're still in the room<br />Smoke on my breath, chains on my chest<br />Damn, you won't cut me loose<br />I just gotta get out of here (I gotta get out of here)<br />Get up off of the floor<br />Find my senses 'cause you meant it<br />You're not coming back no more<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />All the time and the whiskey I've wasted<br />That I ain't ever getting back<br />Oh, I've tried to find the courage just to face it<br />But I can't, I can't<br />And I'm tired of you feeling like a stranger<br />Over and over again<br />Oh, when everything around me keeps changing<br />But I can't (I can't), I can't (I can't), I can't<br />Oh, I can't, I can't<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />All the time and the whiskey I've wasted<br />That I ain't ever getting back<br />I've tried to find the courage just to face it<br />But I can't<br />And I'm tired of you feeling like a stranger<br />Over and over again (over and over again)<br />Oh, when everything around me keeps changing<br />But I can't, I can't, I can't<br /><br />(As hard as I try, as hard as I try, I can't)<br />I can't, I can't<br />(As hard as I try, as hard as I try, I can't)<br />I can't, I can't<br />Oh I can't (As hard as I try, as hard as I try, I can't)<br />(As hard as I try, as hard as I try)<br /><br />Songwriters: Ben West, Caitlyn Smith, and Steven Wilson Jr.<br />Producers: Christian &quot;Leggy&quot; Langdon and Shane McAnally<br /><br />.........<br />👨‍💻 If you like &quot;Caitlyn Smith - I Can't (feat.
