{% raw %}I want to share this cover one more time, to express how important this band is to me. Their influence still drive my soul and you can hear that in my music and in the sounds I create with my instruments.<br />Robots never die, I hope they'll be back someday, somehow.<br />In the meantime I will keep on playing their songs...<br />Thank you, my beloved robots!{% endraw %}
