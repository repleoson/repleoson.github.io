{% raw %}Stainless steel and cast iron are two of the most popular materials when it comes to cookware, but each has its own strengths and weaknesses. To help you decide which pan is right for your cooking needs, we enlisted the help of Anthony Vitolo, the executive chef at Emilio’s Ballato in New York City, and Connie Chen, a home and kitchen reporter at Insider Reviews.
