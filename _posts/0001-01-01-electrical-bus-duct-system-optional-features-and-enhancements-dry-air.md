{% raw %}Has your plant been impacted by increased thermal cycling due to the influx of renewable plants? Is your outdoor electrical bus system subject to drastic environmental temperature fluctuations? Has your plant recently been de-energization/re-energization due to an outage? These are just a few factors that can trigger an unknown condensation issue hiding inside your isolated phase bus duct system. Our 4th installment in our Q&amp;A Vlog Series briefly discusses the benefits of installing a Dry Air Pressurization System on your existing bus duct system to combat condensation.<br /><br />If you have a question for EBIâ€™s technical team, we would love to hear from you!
