{% raw %}The Quick was a dance pop duo from England that consisted of vocalist Colin &quot;Col&quot; Campsie and bassist/keyboardist George McFarlane. Their greatest success in the US came in 1981 when their song &quot;Zulu&quot; spent two weeks at No. 1 on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.<br /><br /><br /><br />McFarlane and Campsie originally met in California in 1978 and began working together when they returned to England, teaming up with guitarist/keyboardist Ivan Penfold and drummer Graham Broad. Augmented by guitarists Rob Greene and Danny McIntosh Jr., the band christened themselves Grand Hotel and in early 1979 released one album for CBS UK under the title of Do Not Disturb. Later that year, Campsie and McFarlane resurfaced as The Quick. Their debut single, &quot;Sharks Are Cool, Jets Are Hot&quot;, was released on CBS affiliate Epic Records in 1979. In 1981, the duo's single, &quot;Hip Shake Jerk&quot;, became a hit in Australia, reaching No. 12, and their first album, On the Uptake was quickly released there. Remixed and repackaged as One Light in a Blackout (in Canada) and Fascinating Rhythm (in Europe), the album was released to the rest of the world in 1982, spawning a U.S. dance hit, &quot;Zulu&quot;. The single &quot;Rhythm of the Jungle&quot; was another Top 20 success in Australia, reaching No. 13, and also became a hit in Europe. Stylistically, this inaugural period for the band was characterized by a hybrid of popular funk, dance, and New Wave influences with an emphasis on bass and keyboards.{% endraw %}
