{% raw %}Types of Faults in Power System | Fault In Electrical Transmission Line<br /><br />In an electric power system, a fault or fault current is any abnormal electric current. For example, a short circuit is a fault in which the current bypasses the normal load. An open-circuit fault occurs if a circuit is interrupted by some failure. In three-phase systems, a fault may involve one or more phases and ground or may occur only between phases. In a &quot;ground fault&quot; or &quot;earth fault&quot;, current flows into the earth. <br /><br />More Videos: <br /><br />Types of Circuit Breaker | Classification of Circuit Breaker |  Circuit Breaker<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/UMCaRjk1ZYU">https://youtu.be/UMCaRjk1ZYU</a><br /><br />Type of Fuse | Different Types of Fuse | How Many Types of Fuse | Various Types of Fuse<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Ta2MkUJqh70">https://youtu.be/Ta2MkUJqh70</a><br /><br />Types of Converters  | Different Types of Converters<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/KMp0qtXkBzU">https://youtu.be/KMp0qtXkBzU</a><br /><br />#ElectricalFaults<br /><br />#TransmissionLine<br /><br />#Learning_Engineering<br /><br />#konok_kamruzzaman<br /><br /><br /><br />Follow me on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Learning.Engring">https://www.facebook.com/Learning.Engring</a><br /><br />Join my Facebook group: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1913745875521183/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/1913745875521183/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Dear Sir, Thanks for watching my videos.
