{% raw %}Advanced English Grammar Course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.espressoenglish.net/advanced-english-grammar-course/">https://www.espressoenglish.net/advanced-english-grammar-course/</a><br /><br />Today I want to teach you how to use the word “lack” correctly.<br /><br />I’ve noticed some of my students making a little mistake with this word, so this lesson will help you learn which one to use – “lack” or “lack of.” It’s a very small detail, but it’s important to learn so that your English grammar is correct.<br /><br />These little details of English grammar can be confusing!<br /><br />That’s why I created the Advanced English Grammar Course, to help make the rules of the language clear – and to help you put them into practice.{% endraw %}
