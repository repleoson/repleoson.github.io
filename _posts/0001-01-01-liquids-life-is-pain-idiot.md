{% raw %}Liquids - Life Is Pain Idiot [2021]<br />Nail Biter Records<br /><br />Now the definitive collection of liq tracks, life is pain idiot. <br /><br />For as much as i love the old snotty production, it's hard to argue that Liquids have ever sounded better than right here. I mean this shit sounds ridiculously good to me. By the time &quot;more thana a friend&quot; hit my ear, it triggered some weird nostalgia trip from when i used to listen to those not so old liquids 7's on repeat (damn, it hasn't felt like 5 years), and to me this record celebrates that feeling in the best way.<br /><br />If you're reading this Mat, thanks for all the tunes. <br /><br />Most importantly, this record would not have been possible without Erik Nervous on the tambourine. He's also responsible for recording the record. A+ <br /><br />There will be a vinyl release in the summer sometime. That's soon to be announced I gather. It'll feature a &quot;scary artwork&quot;, but for what it's worth I actually like this artwork. Leave it. Probably won't though. <br /><br />0:00 When You Were Born (You Should've Died)<br />1:05 Dont Wanna Get to Know You<br />3:20 All U Say<br />4:33 More Thana Friend <br />7:31 Werewolves<br />8:48 You're Burning<br />9:58 Weak<br />11:12 Violent<br />12:32 Tryin'<br />14:57 Think Too Much<br />17:06 Strutter<br />18:33 You're a Punk<br />20:17 Lemon Rice (Doomed to Live) <br />21:55 Shitty Fuckin DNA <br />22:37 Same Mistakes <br />24:21 Prison Food <br />25:32 Nobody Likes You<br />26:27 Night The Lights Went Out <br />28:35 Life Of Oi<br />30:36 Give Up <br />31:27 Defeat <br />33:48 Crutched<br />34:33 11 A.M. <br />35:45 Bat Outta Hell<br />39:03 Zilch <br />40:57 Sick Shit <br />42:09 Bottomless Pit <br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://liquids1.bandcamp.com/album/life-is-pain-idiot">https://liquids1.bandcamp.com/album/life-is-pain-idiot</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: <br />I do NOT own any rights to this content i am merely a fan.
