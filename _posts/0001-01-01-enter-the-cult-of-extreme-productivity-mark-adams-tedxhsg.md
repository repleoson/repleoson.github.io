{% raw %}In this talk Mark shares a dramatic and powerful system that takes productivity thinking to whole new and terrifying level, allowing a person to achieve almost any goal they set themselves with rapid speed. The secret to this type of exponential success? Bin your ‘affirmations’ and ‘goals’ and instead embrace fear as your friend by making irreversible decisions. Instead of hapless resolutions members of the &quot;Lock-In&quot; cult contract with themselves in a way that they cannot escape from (without suffering brutal consequences). The “Lock-In&quot; system harnesses our most primal evolutionary instinct - to avoid pain - and uses it to radically supercharge our lives. Many of the most successful people in history have used its phenomenal power to create extraordinary success. Think you're hardcore enough? Then enter the Cult of Extreme Productivity Mark Adams is Vice President and Head of Innovation at VICE, which has come from humble beginnings as a print magazine to digitally transform into a 5 billion dollar youth media empire. In this talk, Mark describes the cult of extreme productivity that he became part of alongside his brother. The cult is all about making irreversible decisions that make “manifesting” your dreams the only option because not achieving it would create indescribable suffering. This is the second time Mark has done a TEDx talk. The first time his talk was banned. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
