{% raw %}For many of us with BPD, the help just isn't available, whether that's due to where we live, finances or waiting lists.  Does that mean recovery just isn't possible? Nooooo! We can still recover and today I discuss this in todays video.  I also discuss my new website, bpdtribe.com, which will hopefully be launching in a couple of months max!{% endraw %}
