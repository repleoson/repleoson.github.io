But, what is it about models that makes them such an important and powerful tool? And, how do different architecture firms incorporate them into their own and unique design process? This video explores these questions by surveying three firms: Morphosis, MVRDV, and Herzog and de Meuron. Often firms have model shops and dedicated model teams who are responsible for everything from early design decisions to critical client presentations and even marketing the building. We hear from the folks who work in these model shops and breakdown how the three case study firms approach models in their own unique way. <br /><br />__Membership__<br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYAm24PkejQR2xMgJgn7xwg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYAm24PkejQR2xMgJgn7xwg/join</a><br /><br />__About the Channel__<br />Architecture with Stewart is a YouTube journey exploring architecture’s deep and enduring stories in all their bewildering glory.
