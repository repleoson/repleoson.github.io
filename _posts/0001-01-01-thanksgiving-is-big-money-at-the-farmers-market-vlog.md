{% raw %}Thanksgiving means a big family dinner, and a special occasion such as that requires a beautiful fresh bouquet of flowers as a centerpiece for all to admire.  I often wonder about the pleasant conversations that our flower arrangements bring about, it is fun that when we make a video featuring one of these bouquets they can be admired long after they are thrown into the compost pile.  This week is our Thanksgiving market, and they have traditionally been one of our best markets of the season.  Not only is there a flush of fall flowers, and our last harvest of summer veggies before our first frost, but there is the most important element of all for a successful farmers market, an abundance of shoppers with large grocery lists.  People are in the mood to spend, they need salad greens, as well as herbs and root veggies, and lots of people are looking to bring flowers as a gift.  That means, if you bring the goods, no matter the weather, you are guaranteed a good performing market.  This week we had our roadside stand in full effect, and even when the market ended, the sales continued, with our roadside stand selling fresh flower bouquets as fast as we could make them.  It was a great market and a record for roadside sales, which added up to our best weekend of food and flower sales of our 3 years farming.<br /><br />__________<br /><br />Ian and Serina of YOU CANT EAT THE GRASS feel that every small change can make a big difference to the world we live in.
