{% raw %}Here's an overview of my thoughts on the Decent DE1+.<br />If you want a look at my first video on the machine then it's here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUb5O7lQKbE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUb5O7lQKbE</a><br /><br />Note: I mention an issue with the cable - a fix is already underway: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BprPJNDBbJv/">https://www.instagram.com/p/BprPJNDBbJv/</a><br /><br />There's still a lot more to cover about this machine, so there'll probably be more videos in the future. Let me know what you want to see!{% endraw %}
