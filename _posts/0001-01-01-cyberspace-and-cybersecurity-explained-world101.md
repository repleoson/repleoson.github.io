{% raw %}It seems impossible to imagine modern life without the internet, but itâ€™s only fifty years old. Initially created to connect a small group of researchers and U.S. defense officials, the internet is now a vast social and commercial platform that connects four billion people. But as the internet has grown, so have the issues of cybersecurity, data privacy, and online rights. Governments and private companies are always playing catch-up, and different governments have taken different approaches to regulating and enforcing the rules of cyberspace, sometimes creating international conflicts.
