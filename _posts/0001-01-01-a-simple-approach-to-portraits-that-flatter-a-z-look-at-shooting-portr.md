{% raw %}This is not your parent's portrait class!  Using my KISS IT (Keep It Simple Stupid) techniques, I demonstrate how to shoot portraits and how i create flattering portraits with simple lighting and posing techniques.  In this video I will cover everything from camera and lens selection for portraits to camera angles, composition, posing, lighting, backgrounds and more!  I recorded this video during a live presentation to the Lehigh Valley Camera Club in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  The talk included a demonstration using a model and real-time images projected for the audience so that you can see these simple techniques through the camera lens.<br /><br />Many of you know that I regularly do talks for camera clubs and photography organizations and every time I mention that I am about to go off to give a talk, people ask if I could live stream them or record them for YouTube.<br /><br />I just wanted to explain that the live stream is rarely an option because generally the group that I am speaking to is paying me to do the talk and they are usually charging a small fee for people to attend.  That's part of how camera clubs and photo organizations stay afloat.  If I live stream it - then there is no reason for people to attend the talk - and then there is no reason for groups to hire me.<br /><br />As for recording them, more often than not, the lighting is not ideal and the space is often not conducive to making a good recording.  This past week, thanks to the great folks at the Lehigh Valley Camera Club in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, I was able to record one of my very popular talks called A Simple Approach to Portraits that Flatter.<br /><br />Nothing special here… two go pro cameras and I was able to wear a mic so that you have clear audio to listen to.  This is a talk that I normally do in 90 minutes, condensed into 60 minutes for this group with a 15 minute question and answer session afterwards.<br /><br />So for those of you who want to know what I am like in person… here you go… but just remember - be careful what you wish for!<br /><br />Looking for a PHOTOGRAPHY MENTOR?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.joeedelman.com/edu/mentoring-for-photographers/">https://www.joeedelman.com/edu/mentoring-for-photographers/</a><br /><br />WANNA SEE MY GEAR?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://joeedelman.fyi/gear">https://joeedelman.fyi/gear</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE so that you don’t miss NEW VIDEOS!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tog.chat/ytsubscribe">https://tog.chat/ytsubscribe</a><br /><br />MY WEBSITE with my portfolio and over 300 articles <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.JoeEdelman.com">https://www.JoeEdelman.com</a><br /><br />SHOP FOR TOGSWAG℠<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.togswag.com">http://www.togswag.com</a><br /><br /><br />LET'S CONNECT!<br />- Follow on INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/joeedelman/">https://www.instagram.com/joeedelman/</a><br />- Follow on TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/joeedelman">https://twitter.com/joeedelman</a><br />- Check my boards on PINTEREST: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/thejoeedelman/">https://www.pinterest.com/thejoeedelman/</a><br />- Connect on LINKEDIN: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thejoeedelman/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/thejoeedelman/</a><br />FTC Disclosure:  No sponsors have paid for placement in this video.<br />#ishootpeople #joeedelman{% endraw %}
