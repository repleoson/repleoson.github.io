{% raw %}PANTA ENGINEERING<br />Zack Zhu<br />Mob/WhatsApp:+8618856420577<br />Email:info@pantaengineering.com<br />Web:www.cnptengineering.com<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />The laser hand-held laser welding machine adopts the latest generation of fiber lasers and is equipped with a self-developed wobble welding head to fill the gap of hand-held welding in the laser equipment industry. It has the advantages of simple operation, beautiful weld seam, fast welding speed and no consumables. Welding of metal materials such as stainless steel plates, iron plates, and galvanized plates can perfectly replace traditional argon arc welding and electric welding. The hand-held laser welding machine can be widely used in complex and irregular welding processes in cabinet kitchens, stair elevators, shelves, ovens, stainless steel door and window guardrails, distribution boxes, stainless steel homes and other industries.{% endraw %}
