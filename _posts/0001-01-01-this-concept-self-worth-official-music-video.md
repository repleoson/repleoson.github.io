You are different but that's no reason to believe you're worthless. Never let words from the past upset you. <br />You will grow, and prove everyone wrong. <br />They were wrong. <br />Popping pills to try and make you feel sane, <br />Attend counselling at a young age, <br />All because of the hurtful words spat on your face as a child.<br /><br />You will grow and prove everyone wrong, they were wrong.{% endraw %}
