The lighter is very oxidized and in need of a restoration. I also thought it looked worthy of gold plating so I wanted to practice that skjill on it. I used laser cleaner loaned to me by W2M to clean up the dirty and oxidized surfaces. You can find more about their lasers from here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://w2m.fi/?lang=en">https://w2m.fi/?lang=en</a><br /><br />After cleaning the parts were polished and then decreased with acetone.  This will allow me to get nice shiny plating on the parts. I used an electroless nickel plating method. I prefer it over electroplating as it usually gives better results and plated parts evenly on the inside as well. electroplating can have issues were plating is much thicker is some areas and some areas are hard to plate because current doesn't flow through all the areas of the metal in the same way. But in the end both methods have their own advantages. If you are a beginner in metal plating I recommend checking out my electroplating tutorial. Electroplatin is by far the easiest method fo r a beginner. Link to the tutorial: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/O3DCexCLoGQ">https://youtu.be/O3DCexCLoGQ</a><br /><br />Once the parts were nickel plated I gold plated it with electroplating method called brush plating were you just rub the electrolyte on the surface of the item and gold will appear on the surface.<br /><br />I also needed to make a new gasket to replace the old one. I just took thick gasket paper and used hole punches to make a ring of the correct size.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the video as much as I enjoyed making it.
