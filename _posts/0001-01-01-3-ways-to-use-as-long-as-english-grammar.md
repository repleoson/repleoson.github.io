Take the quiz here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.engvid.com/as-long-as/">http://www.engvid.com/as-long-as/</a><br /><br />TRANSCRIPT<br /><br />Hi guys. I'm Alex. Thanks for clicking, and welcome to this lesson on &quot;as long as&quot;. Now, this lesson is not about &quot;as long as&quot; in a comparative sense, like, if I say, &quot;My arm is as long as three rulers, maybe?&quot; But it is about three other ways that we can use this very common, everyday expression. So a couple things that we have to learn about &quot;as long as&quot;, and we'll do them in a three-step process. <br /><br />No. 1: we're going to look at this sentence, and you will tell me what is the correct way to finish it. So the sentence is, &quot;I will remember you as long as I live/I will live.&quot; Which one do you think is correct in this situation? Okay, well, you already have &quot;I will&quot; in the first part of the sentence, so you don't really need it in the second part. The reason for this is that we generally use &quot;as long as&quot; in the present tense, okay? So: &quot;as long as I live&quot;. We don't really say &quot;as long as he will live&quot; or &quot;I will be here&quot; or whatever it is. Generally, we just keep it in the present tense. Now, it is possible to use in the past as well. We just don't really use it with &quot;will&quot;. What does &quot;as long as&quot; mean? Well, in this situation, it actually means, like, &quot;for the duration of&quot;, &quot;for the duration of the period&quot;. So &quot;for the duration of my life&quot;, &quot;as long as I live&quot;, &quot;for the duration of this period&quot;, okay? <br /><br />The second sentence says, &quot;You can come as long as you're quiet.&quot; So if you have a friend who's very talkative, who's very social and loud, and you don't want to them to come with you to, let's say, the grocery store or in a public place. But you tell them, &quot;as long as you're quiet, you can come.&quot; What do you think &quot;as long as&quot; means in this situation? What can you replace it with? When you look at the context, you might think of the word &quot;if&quot;, right? So &quot;as long as&quot; can also be used <br />to mean &quot;on the condition that&quot;, okay? So, &quot;as long as&quot; here means &quot;on the condition that&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;On the condition that you are quiet, you can come.&quot; So think of it a little bit like &quot;if&quot;, okay? Now, finally, we have &quot;The meeting could be as long as three hours!&quot; Now, after &quot;as long as&quot;, we said that we can use it for duration, and this is definitely duration, not condition. But what we are doing is we are emphasizing, right? It's to emphasize a really long time. So if you want to emphasize a really long time, you can also use &quot;as long as&quot;. So we can use it for emphasis before a number. And I apologize for my writing. I think you guys can understand that, okay? So we can use &quot;as long as&quot; to talk about duration. We can use it to talk about conditions, and we can also use it to emphasize a number like a really long time.<br /><br />So I have three more sentences at the bottom, and I'd just like you to tell me how we're using &quot;as long as&quot; in these three situations. &quot;I will help as long as you buy pizza!&quot; So if you have a new building, a new apartment, you have just moved in a new house, and you're painting. You need to paint your house. You invite some friends, and one of your friends says, &quot;Okay, I will help as long as you buy pizza -- right? -- for us, for helping.&quot; So this is obviously condition, okay? So I'm going to just put -- maybe I'll write it here -- &quot;condition&quot;, just &quot;con.&quot; This is a condition. I will help as long as you buy pizza, on the condition that you buy pizza. &quot;He can talk for as long as 1 hour!&quot; So if you have, again, a very talkative, chatty person, a talkative friend, and you want to emphasize -- right -- -that, &quot;Oh, my goodness, they can talk forever.&quot; So here, this is for emphasis. And finally, &quot;As long as I'm here, I will help.&quot; So again, this is for duration -- &quot;for the period of time that I am here&quot;, okay? So guys, here are three ways that you can use this very common, everyday, English expression.<br /><br />I'd like to thank you guys for listening to this and listening to me for the past 100 videos.
