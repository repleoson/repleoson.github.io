{% raw %}This physics video tutorial provides a basic introduction into sound intensity and the inverse square law.  It explains how to solve physics problems associated with sound intensity and it provides the inverse square law formula to calculate the intensity at any distance from the source.  Intensity is defined as power divided by the surface area of a sphere.  It also explains how to calculate the power emitted by the sound and the energy received by the eardrum after a certain time has elapsed.  <br /><br />New Physics Video Playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0o_zxa4K1BU6wPPLDsoTj1_wEf0LSNeR">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0o_zxa4K1BU6wPPLDsoTj1_wEf0LSNeR</a><br /><br />Access to Premium Videos:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor">https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MathScienceTutoring/">https://www.facebook.com/MathScienceTutoring/</a>{% endraw %}
