{% raw %}As part of our on-site visit with DataON in Anaheim, we were able to coordinate several interviews with DataON partners. One of the most critical is the relationship with Intel. Intel supplies the servers, CPUs and storage for DataON's integrated systems. What's pretty cool is that Intel will prep the whole system and drop it off with DataON for Azure Stack HCI OS install and system burn in. There's not even a minimum order, so even DataON's smallest customers get their systems fast. <br /><br />In addition to how Intel enables partners, Brian spoke with Gina Merjanian about Intel's manufacturing processes, the latest on Intel's fab strategy in the US, momentum around Ice Lake and much more.{% endraw %}
