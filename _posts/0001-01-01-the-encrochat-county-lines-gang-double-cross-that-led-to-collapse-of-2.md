A double cross set up in Swansea led to bag containing  Â£106,000 in cash which members of a London-based organised crime group had just collected after dropping off a consignment of cocaine in Swansea. And equally as worrying for the dealers, hidden inside a secret compartment in that van - a van the police now had possession of - was another Â£81,000 cash and more than a 1kg of coke. The dealers desperately wanted the vehicle back before police found what was inside.<br /><br />While the robbers had got clean away with the loot, they had made one crucial mistake which would lead police to discovering a Â£2m drug dealing trafficking operation that was shipping huge quantities of high-purity coke from London to Wales.<br /><br />Further enquiries, boosted by the wealth of information which became available when the EncroChat phone network was compromised and accessed, led police beyond Swansea, and further raids and arrests were carried out at locations in Bristol, Kent and London.<br /><br />The investigation also found that following the Dyfatty robbery Wood, &quot;anxious to continue in the drug supply business&quot;, had turned his attention to ketamine and was involved in organising the transportation of more than 20kg of the drug into south Wales. This side of his operation was taken down when police stopped his Bristol-based courier on the A470 near Cardiff with 5kg of ketamine in the boot of her car.<br /><br />ðŸ”´ Follow Scarcity on socials ðŸ”´  <br />ðŸŸª Insta: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/ScarcityInsta">https://bit.ly/ScarcityInsta</a> ðŸŸª<br />ðŸŸ¥ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/ScarcityFB">https://bit.ly/ScarcityFB</a> ðŸŸ¥<br />ðŸŸ¦Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/ScarcityTwitter">https://bit.ly/ScarcityTwitter</a> ðŸŸ¦<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.scarcity-studios.com">https://www.scarcity-studios.com</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1XI4TFW_nEY4IFfTxUUkCg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1XI4TFW_nEY4IFfTxUUkCg/join</a><br /><br />Alpha Claims and Hire are Birmingham's leading accident management company specialising in non-fault claims. <br /><br />Are you a taxi driver?<br />Have you been involved in a accident?<br />Do you need a accident replacement car?<br /><br />Call us on: 0121 327 0382<br /><br />We stock cars for Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Solihull, Walsall Councils, and many more councils across the UK.<br />Alpha claims and hire stocks euro 6, clean air zone compliant cars. <br /><br /><br />************************************************<br /><br />Alpha claims and hire opened its doors in 2009.
