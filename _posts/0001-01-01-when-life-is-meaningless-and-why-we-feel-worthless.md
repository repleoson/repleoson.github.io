{% raw %}Why are we thrown into this world? What are we here to do? Could it be that we’re here for no particular reason and that life on Earth is nothing more than a beautiful yet meaningless coincidence?<br /><br />In times of religious decline, mankind is faced with the possibility that its existence is inherently meaningless. For many, this is frightening. The idea that our lives don’t matter, can be difficult to accept.<br /><br />To give our lives at least some significance, even if it’s just on a terrestrial level, we started to create our own meaning. So, as the humans we are, we began to define what it means to live a meaningful life. What’s worth living for, and what isn’t? What are the requirements?<br /><br />When we have decided what a meaningful life entails, we continue grasping for it in an almost pathological manner. Because if we fail to give our lives meaning, our lives truly don’t matter.<br /><br />As a consequence, many people feel that their lives are worthless. They wake up, eat, engage in their daily activities, eat, go to sleep, repeat, repeat, and repeat, as opposed to those ‘lucky few’ who have found meaning in their lives, albeit because of raising children, a so-called ‘meaningful’ job, and other activities that make their existence on this desolate tiny dot surrounded by a suffocating blackness, a bit more bearable.<br /><br />This video explores why we feel worthless, and the beauty and ugliness of a meaningless life (inspired by philosopher Albert Camus).<br /><br />Support the channel:<br />✔️ PayPal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/einzelgangerco">https://www.paypal.me/einzelgangerco</a><br />✔️ Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/einzelgangster">https://www.patreon.com/einzelgangster</a><br />✔️ Bitcoin: 3HQnEz1LQ4G6dqN2LdZgzc7qoJjJCyWjTC<br />(Donated BTC and want in the credits?
