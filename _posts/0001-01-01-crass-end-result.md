{% raw %}I am a product. I am a symbol of endless, hopeless, fruitless, aimless games.<br />I'm a glossy packages on the supermarket shelf.<br />My contents aren't fit for human consumption.<br />I could tragically injure your perfect health.<br />My ingredients will seize up your body function.<br />I'm the dirt that everyone walks on.<br />I am the orphan nobody wants.<br />I am the staircarpet everyone walks on.<br />I am the leper nobody wants to touch.......... much.<br />I am a sample. I am a scapegoat of useless, futureless, endless, mindless ideas.<br />I'm a number on the paper you file away.<br />I'm a portfolio you stick in the drawer.<br />I'm the fool you try to scare when you say<br />We know all about you, of that you can be sure.<br />Well, I don't want your crazy system,<br />I don't want to be on your files.<br />Your temptations I try to resist them<br />Cos I know what hides beneath your smiles, it's.......... EST.<br />I am a topic. I am subject a for useless, futureless, endless, mindless debates.<br />You think up ways that you can hide<br />From the naieve eyes of your figurehead,<br />But don't you find that it ain't easy?<br />Wouldn't you love to see me dead?<br />Your answer is to give me treatment<br />For crying out when you give me pain,<br />Leave me with no possible remnant,<br />You poke your knives into my brain, you send me.......... insane.<br />I am an example. I'm no hero of the great, intelligent, magnificent human race.<br />I'm part of the race that kills for possesions<br />Part of the race that's wiping itself out.<br />I'm part of the race that's got crazy obsessions<br />Like locking people up, not letting them out.<br />I hate the living dead and their work in factories.<br />They go like sheep to their production lines.<br />They live on illusions, don't face the realities,<br />All they live for is that big blue sign, it says, it says..........<br />I'M BORED, BORED, BORED, BORED.{% endraw %}
