{% raw %}We Contain Multitudes was written at a friend's cabin, late at night, on a tiny electric keyboard. At the time I had spent so much time away from what I had considered home, almost setting up a separate life on the other side of the planet. My mind was going through a process of learning to live in two vastly different cultures, of recognising that within one body there are multitudes of different and often contradictory facets of personality.<br /><br />Here I perform it live from my home in Reykjavík. <br /><br />Listen here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mkx.lnk.to/OASKOPID">https://mkx.lnk.to/OASKOPID</a> <br /><br />My new album, some kind of peace, is coming out on November 6th. <br />You can pre-order/pre-save it here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mkx.lnk.to/OASKOPID">https://mkx.lnk.to/OASKOPID</a><br /><br />Video:<br />Directed by Blair Alexander<br />Lighting by Óttar Andri Óttarsson{% endraw %}
