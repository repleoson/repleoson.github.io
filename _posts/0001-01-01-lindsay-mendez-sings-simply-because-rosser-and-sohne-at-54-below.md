LeAnne Parker and her daughter Amber are still struggling with the aftermath of this loss when a boy claiming to be Austin shows up in town. Though he looks different than the child they remember, LeAnne believes him, creating a rift with her more skeptical daughter. Part thriller, part psychological drama, Run Away Home is about the power of hope, the dangers of self-deception and the consequences of bringing long buried secrets to light.<br /><br />In this song, Amber reflects on all that her brother meant to her.<br /><br />Piano - Tim Rosser<br />Guitar - Eric Davis<br />Bass - Mary McSweeney<br />Violin - Whitney LaGrange<br />Cello - Alisa Horn<br />Drums - Jay Mack<br /><br />Produced by Shoshana Feinstein<br />Video by Kevin Alexander{% endraw %}
