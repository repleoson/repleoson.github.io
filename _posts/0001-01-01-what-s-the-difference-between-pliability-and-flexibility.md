{% raw %}Everybody moves differently. Whether you're running up and down the court, carrying groceries to your car, or bending down to pick something up — movement is universal. Whatever movements you’re asking your body to perform, your goal should be to feel your best while doing them.<br /><br />People today associate movement with the terms #flexibility, #mobility, and #pliability, and it’s common to hear them used interchangeably.  Often times, however, people misuse or misunderstand them. Our focus for this video is to educate you on the meanings of each of these terms and shed some light on how these concepts can work together to help achieve the common goal of functional movement. <br /><br />The end goal for all of us is functional movement. But to be able to move as functionally as possible, you need to understand that pliability acts as the ultimate enabler.  It helps to enhance both mobility and flexibility and empowers us to do what we love better and for longer.<br /><br /><br />Shop » <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tb12sports.com/shop">https://tb12sports.com/shop</a> <br />Twitter » <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/tb12sports">https://twitter.com/tb12sports</a> <br />Instagram » <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tb12sports/">https://www.instagram.com/tb12sports/</a> <br />TB12 Mobile App » <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tb12branch.app.link/TB12MobileApp">https://tb12branch.app.link/TB12MobileApp</a>{% endraw %}
