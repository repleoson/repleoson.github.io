MORE HERE:<br /><br />Song Title: Birdhouse in Your Soul<br /><br />Produced by: They Might Be Giants, Alan Winstanley,<br />Clive Langer<br /><br />Label: Elektra Records ( Released in 1990 Recorded in 1989 at Skyline Studios in New York City )<br /><br />John Flansburgh and John Linnell are They Might Be Giants<br /><br />Alan Bezozi -- Drums<br />Mark Feldman -- Violin<br />Rick McRae -- Trombone<br />Frank London -- Trumpet<br />Charlie Spalvida -- Trumpet<br />Marion Beckenstein -- Vocals<br />Joel Mitchell -- Vocals<br />The Skyline Staff -- Handclaps<br />Arto Lindsay -- Guitar<br /><br /> <br /><br />Trivia/Info:<br /><br />The song is a story of a child's nightlight, told from the nightlight's point of view.<br /><br />The Longines Symphonette is a hand-held pocket radio, manufactured in the 1960s. It is also a record label which specialized in releasing classic radio programs and multiple-record box sets. Linnell admits, though, &quot;I didn't find out what the Longines Symphonette was until after the song was released,&quot; in a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone.<br /><br />The song's video was directed by Adam Bernstein and filmed inside the New York County's Surrogate's Court and Hall of Records building located at 31 Chambers Street in Manhattan. &quot;I tell people it's my house.&quot; - Linnell<br /><br />Blue Canary is the title of a 1953 song by Vincent Fiorino, which has lyrics on the sadder side about loneliness and comforting but has &quot;happy&quot; music. Also, the 1948 song &quot;Bluebird of Happiness&quot; as performed by Art Mooney (which reminds that, &quot;Though you're deep in blue, you will see a ray of light creep through&quot;) may have influenced the line about a &quot;bluebird of friendliness&quot;.<br /><br /> PS: This tidbit from intrepid youtuber &quot; thatcher81&quot; : <br />&quot;Fun fact: The first girl mimicking a lighthouse at 1:51 to 1:54 in this video is &quot;Helen&quot; from the sitcom &quot;Wings.&quot; She is a huge TMBG fan and asked to be in a video (video was filmed when Wings was at its height of popularity)&quot;.<br /><br />WHILE YOU`RE AT IT, SUBSCRIBE TO THE<br />OFFICIAL ' THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS ' YOUTUBE AND FACEBOOK PAGES :<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ParticleMen#p/u">http://www.youtube.com/user/ParticleMen#p/u</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/theymightbegiants?ref=s">http://www.facebook.com/theymightbegiants?ref=s</a><br /><br /> Like it ?

We're not sure, but we suspect the sparrow that doesn't tell you anything you want to know had something to do with it--or Triangle Man, who always seems to win.<br /><br />Plug this little guy in an outlet by a light switch and the energy efficient, light-sensitive LED will glow cheerfully as light fades. You'll never have to whistle in the dark again! Unless that's the only one thing that you like, in which case you can leave the Blue Canary unplugged from the Outlet by the Light Switch.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/BlueCanaryNightLight-com-Blue-Canary-Night-Light/dp/B002SLGNJG">https://www.amazon.com/BlueCanaryNightLight-com-Blue-Canary-Night-Light/dp/B002SLGNJG</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bluecanarynightlight.com">http://bluecanarynightlight.com</a>{% endraw %}
