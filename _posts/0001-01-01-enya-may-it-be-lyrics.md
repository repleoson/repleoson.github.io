{% raw %}Enya - May it be<br /><br />lyrics:<br />May it be an evening star<br />Shines down upon you<br />May it be when darkness falls<br />Your heart will be true<br />You walk a lonely road<br />Oh! How far you are from home<br /><br />Mornie utúlië (darkness has come)<br />Believe and you will find your way<br />Mornie alantië (darkness has fallen)<br />A promise lives within you now<br /><br />May it be the shadows call<br />Will fly away<br />May it be you journey on<br />To light the day<br />When the night is overcome<br />You may rise to find the sun<br /><br />Mornie utúlië (darkness has come)<br />Believe and you will find your way<br />Mornie alantië (darkness has fallen)<br />A promise lives within you now<br /><br />A promise lives within you now<br /><br /><br />I hope you like it<br />I don't own anything =]{% endraw %}
