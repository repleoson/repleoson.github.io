{% raw %}The ALL NEW Tundra is taking the truck world by storm for 2022. Toyota wanted to take the TRD Pro to the next level by showing what could be with this new platform. On the outside you will notice ultra flared carbon fiber fenders, 18in Method off-road wheels, custom steel bumper, and Rigid LED lights. On the inside you will be greeted to the all new interior with a 12.3in digital display and 14in infotainment system. Under the hood you have the 3.5L twin-turbo V6 paired with an electric motor to produce 437HP &amp; mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission.
