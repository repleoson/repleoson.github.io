{% raw %}Here's my new workplace. Hooray!<br /><br />My galaxy background tapestry is available here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://society6.com/product/pastel-galaxy1688045_tapestry?sku=s6-10026499p42a55v412">https://society6.com/product/pastel-galaxy1688045_tapestry?sku=s6-10026499p42a55v412</a><br /><br />Camera: Canon EOS Rebel SL3 (found out about it through @Photo Genius ; I highly recommend his channel!)<br /><br />Editing software: Cyberlink Power Director 19<br /><br />The song I titled &quot;Bubble Pop&quot; was created using a software called Garage Band. I used their copyright free loops and recording capabilites to patch together a tune that's become this channel's theme-song.<br /><br />#studiotour #workroom #catassistants{% endraw %}
