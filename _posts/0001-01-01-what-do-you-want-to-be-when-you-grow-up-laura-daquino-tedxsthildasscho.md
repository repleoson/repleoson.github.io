{% raw %}When someone asks &quot;who are you?&quot; what do you answer. Do you define yourself by your job? and are you simply just you. Where are you going?<br /><br />Laura Daquino is a St Hilda’s Old Girl and Journalist for Business News Australia, who specialises in writing about the startup ecosystem, entrepreneurship and big ideas. She is especially passionate about female and youth entrepreneurship, applying this passion to help organise and host the annual Gold Coast and Brisbane Young Entrepreneur Awards. Laura spends her days interviewing inspiring and innovative people, pretending that speaking to someone like Erin Brockovich is work, when really it’s just a whole lot of fun.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
