{% raw %}In this video I present a high level overview on how to manage your money using the 50/30/20 Rule. <br /><br />Money management is 90% discipline and 10% knowledge. The 50/30/20 rule will force you to create a budget and understand where every single one of your after-tax dollars is going. <br /><br />50% of your budget should be spent on needs which are are things that are essential to life and that you literally cannot live without. <br /><br />30% should be spent on wants which could be classified as things that bring you joy and happiness, but are NOT essential to living. (Dining out, entertainment, hobbies, etc.) <br />The final 20% should be spent on savings, paying off debt, and retirement planning.<br /><br />I feel like a lot of people confuse wants for needs, and we know the difference deep down, but we really want the one that we don't have the self-discipline to say no. <br /><br />WBF UNIVERSITY - JOIN MY SCHOOL HERE<br />â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com/wbf-university-waitlist">https://whiteboardfinance.com/wbf-university-waitlist</a><br /><br />LIMITED TIME - Get 1 FREE STOCK ON ROBINHOOD<br />â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/robinhood">https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/robinhood</a><br /><br />FUNDRISE - INVEST IN REAL ESTATE FOR ONLY $500<br />â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/fundrise">https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/fundrise</a><br /><br />M1 FINANCE - INVEST FOR FREE (Yes, Really)<br />â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/m1-finance">https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/m1-finance</a><br /><br />My FREE M1 Finance Training Video<br />â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/m1-finance-training">https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/m1-finance-training</a><br /><br />My FREE Stock Market For Beginners Guide<br />â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/stockmarket4beginners">https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/stockmarket4beginners</a><br /><br />GET MY HOME AFFORDABILITY SPREADSHEET HERE<br />â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/whiteboardfinance">https://www.patreon.com/whiteboardfinance</a><br /><br />SCHEDULE A COACHING CALL WITH ME<br />â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/marko-coaching">https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/marko-coaching</a><br /><br />HOW TO BUY &amp; STORE BITCOIN<br />â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/bitcoin">https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/bitcoin</a><br /><br />THE BEST CREDIT CARDS TO USE RIGHT NOW<br />â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/best-credit-cards">https://whiteboardfinance.com/go/best-credit-cards</a><br /><br />CHECK OUT MY BLOG:<br />â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whiteboardfinance.com">https://whiteboardfinance.com</a><br /><br />FOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM<br />â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/whiteboardfinance">https://www.instagram.com/whiteboardfinance</a><br /><br />Instrumental Produced By Chuki:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/CHUKImusic">http://www.youtube.com/user/CHUKImusic</a><br /><br />ABOUT ME ðŸ‘‡<br /><br />My mission is to provide my viewers with actionable content that enables them to create financial wealth.
