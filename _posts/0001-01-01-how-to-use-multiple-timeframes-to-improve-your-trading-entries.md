{% raw %}It’s no secret that…<br /><br />Using multiple timeframes can improve your trading entries.<br /><br />But the problem is… most traders are confused on how to do it.<br /><br />For example, one of my subscribers recently asked me…<br /><br />Rayner, how do I use multiple timeframes in my trading?<br /><br />Should I be looking at the daily, weekly or monthly timeframe?<br /><br />What if I have a long trading opportunity, but the higher timeframe is against me. Do I take the trade or skip it?<br /><br />Those are all valid questions. <br /><br />But first… let me share with you something important. <br /><br />Your higher timeframe (HTF) is dependent on your entry timeframe.<br /><br />For some traders, their higher timeframe could be the 1-hour chart.<br />And for others, their higher timeframe could be the weekly chart.<br /><br />Now, you’re probably wondering…<br /><br />How do I know what’s the “correct” higher timeframe for my trading style?<br /><br />That’s a good question.  <br /><br />So… <br /><br />Go watch today’s video and learn how to trade using multiple timeframes, the “correct” way.<br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />FOLLOW ME AT: <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/forextradingwithrayner">https://www.facebook.com/groups/forextradingwithrayner</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/rayner_teo">http://www.twitter.com/rayner_teo</a><br />My YouTube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/tradingwithrayner">https://www.youtube.com/tradingwithrayner</a>{% endraw %}
