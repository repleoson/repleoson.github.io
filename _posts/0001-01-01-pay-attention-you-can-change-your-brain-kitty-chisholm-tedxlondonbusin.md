{% raw %}Hot on the heels of her new book, “Neuroscience for Leadership”, Kitty gives us insight into the power of attention as a key mechanism to change your brain.<br /><br />A professional coach helping leaders achieve sustainable change, Kitty Chisholm developed a passionate interest in how people and organisations learn and change through her work with the Open University. As a founder Director of BoardwalkLeadership, she uses her knowledge of how brains can be changed to support more women into leadership and companies to develop a more diverse leadership pipeline. <br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
