{% raw %}MILCK - Quiet (Official Video)<br /><br />Trigger Warning: This video portrays subtle yet sensitive material regarding sexual assault.<br /><br />Stream/Download: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Atlantic.lnk.to/ICantKeepQuietID">https://Atlantic.lnk.to/ICantKeepQuietID</a><br /><br />LETTER FROM MILCK:<br /> Hi, friends and family. Hope everyone is doing well during these unpredictable times. In light of the Harvey Weinstein scandals sparking a massive movement of women and survivors speaking out against sexual assault, I find myself in awe and moved to my core. Since the age of 14 I’ve survived several acts of sexual assault. For years, I blamed myself and secretly carried the shame. When I did realize it wasn’t my fault and that I deserve to heal, I wrote a song called “Quiet,” which went viral after I sang it with a choir on the streets @ the D.C. Women’s March.<br /> <br />Since then I have teamed up with Atlantic Records to create a hopeful, new version that incorporates survivors singing with me. I’ve seen this song help survivors speak out after the Women’s March, and I believe that the new version has the power to encourage and empower all those thinking of coming forward at this time.<br /> <br />Even though I was planning to release this new version of “Quiet” in January, I believe the movement is happening now, and I want to support those breaking the silence by releasing “Quiet” early. I’m deeply moved Julie Greenwald @ Atlantic is standing beside me through this change of plan. She understands that it’s my gesture of support &amp; encouragement to all the survivors rising. It’s my musical #METOO.<br /> <br />I hope you’ll listen and consider standing with us as well.

She began crafting her talent at a young age by enrolling in classical piano and opera classes. Inspired by artist from Frederic Chopin to Radiohead and Imogen Heap, she experienced something of an awakening in her college's underground piano rooms. <br /><br />While her song &quot;Devil Devil&quot; hit success, it wasn't until her anthem &quot;Quiet&quot; made waves at the 2017 Women's March and on the internet, garnering over 14 million Facebook plays in 2 days and sparking the #ICanttKeepQuiet movement. <br /><br />With the goal to help people feel empowered, she sings for the relentless, the vulnerable, and the brave.{% endraw %}
