{% raw %}The three Rs<br /><br />Hello I am the Earth, yup the very planet you live on. There are three words which start with the letter R which I love. They are: Reduce, reuse and recycle. Do you know why I love them so much? Because they are almost magical words. Together they can make all living things as well as myself be happier. I said that they are “almost” magical because without your help it won't work, they need all of you children in order to do the trick. Each and every one of you are the real 3Rs magicians, those three words which can change the world. Do you want to know how? Yes? Well let's find out.<br /><br />The first R is for reduce. If you think about it, there are many things you don’t need. When you go to the supermarket, I am sure you could take your own canvas bags instead of using disposable ones given to you. This way you will be reducing the amount of plastic which is very contaminating. And I am sure that you don’t need to print out so many documents or photos, nor leave the lights, television or computer on when you are not using them. If you remember this, you will be reducing the amount of paper being used as well as energy, and in turn will be helping reduce the contamination. And these are just a few examples. I am sure you can think of many more different ways to reduce what you are using or creating unnecessary waste. The following question will help you with this task: Do I really need this or is this just a whim?<br />The second R is for recycling. Now  it is easier than ever to recycle things we don’t need any more so that they can be reused. Near your home you can find places, like the recycling station and containers for cans, plastic, paper or organic waste. They each have their specific colors to make them easier. By using them, you will avoid contaminating nature, the rivers and seas as well as the atmosphere, which is the air we breathe.<br /> <br />And finally we have the third R, which refers to reuse. How many things do you think we can reuse again and again instead of throwing them away? Let´s see…a piece of paper that has only one side printed on it, a carton box, a plastic bottle…you think now. With just a bit of imagination, I am sure you will come up with many more exciting and fun new uses for them. <br />And remember: if you apply the 3Rs rule, you will make me a much cleaner planet, with less contamination and where we all can enjoy a better life. <br /><br />Because as you know…children can make the world of difference.{% endraw %}
