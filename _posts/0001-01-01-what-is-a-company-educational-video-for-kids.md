There<br />are loads of companies all dedicated in manufacturing all<br />sorts of different products!<br /><br />If you look around you, all you see has been produced in a<br />company.<br /><br />There are also companies which provide services, such as<br />the transport companies which take us from one place to<br />another, the hairdressers who don’t sell us anything but<br />cut our hair and brush it, giving us a service as well as<br />making us look preIy. Check out all these different hair<br />styles!<br /><br />There are a great number of services offered by<br />companies.<br /><br />To carry out these activities, companies need material and<br />human resources. The material resources are what the<br />companies need to manufacture or produce something.<br />For example, a bakery needs flour, ovens, utensils,<br />vehicles to deliver the bread to the clients etc, etc…<br />A company which produces fruit juice would need fruit, a<br />juice squeezer, refrigerators, packaging, and trucks for<br />transportation…<br /><br />So as to create a product one needs many resources and<br />that is why we should never waste anything and we must<br />recycle the juice container for example.<br />The human resources are the people who work in the<br />companies. These people are the employees and<br />employers.<br /><br />The employers are those who create a company, direct it<br />and make sure all is working correctly, besides they are<br />the ones who are risking their money.<br /><br />The employees are the people who are working in the<br />company in exchange for a salary, from their pay sheet,<br />meaning money.<br /><br />An enterprise´s spirit is one who plans projects and brings<br />them to life. If you want something, you can have it!<br />Well now we know what a company is all about. In the<br />next video we will learn more about different types of<br />companies.{% endraw %}
