{% raw %}In this video, I turned the camera on while mixing to show you the steps I took to get a balanced mix. I use an approach called &quot;Top-Down Mixing&quot; where I start by setting a static mix before adding effects and automating. These techniques can be applied when mixing many types of music. Feel free to ask me any questions about these methods in the comments below.<br /><br />►The song is called &quot;You&quot; by The Workday Release. Listen to the final mix here on YouTube:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/a7iy1OZlG3g">https://youtu.be/a7iy1OZlG3g</a><br /><br />The final mix was done by Andy Toy (@andytoymusic), a brilliant engineer and mixer. I am using the stems in this video because I wanted to try my hand at the mix too.<br /><br />►Gear/Software used:<br />DAW: FL Studio 20 (all DAWs have similar function)<br />Free Plugins: TDR Kotelnikov, Nova Dynamic EQ, Molotok Compressor and Slick EQ<br />Interface: Lynx Hilo<br />Headphones: Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pro 250 Ohm<br />Speakers: PSI A23-M<br /><br /><br />0:00 - Intro<br />1:00 - Listening to the stems<br />2:00 - Top-Down mixing<br />5:50 - Vocal Reverb and Delay<br />8:55 - Piano and Guitar <br />11:40 - Backing vocals<br />13:00 - Vocal Effects<br />14:40 - Bass and Drums<br />18:50 - Adjusting more tracks<br />20:35 - Vocal Automation<br />22:30 - Take a break<br />23:20 - Listening to the mix <br />23:45 - Vocal editing<br />25:45 - Side-chaining<br />26:50 - Listening to the mix<br />27:15 - More automations<br />29:20 - Global EQ<br />30:45 - Final thoughts and revisions<br /><br /><br />► Get my Sound Bank: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/inthemixstore​​">http://bit.ly/inthemixstore​​</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► Join my free discord server here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/sBbsE6e">https://discord.gg/sBbsE6e</a><br /><br />► Save money on DistroKid if you signup through my custom link → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://distrokid.com/vip/inthemix">http://distrokid.com/vip/inthemix</a>{% endraw %}
