You will notice the bottom right either has text or an image of the appropriate rank. This tells the viewers what COMMS they are listening to! For example if it's Bronze red, you are listening to the Bronze team which is on the red-side. This helps you keep track while watching!<br /><br />*Understanding Dynamic Nerfing &amp; Game Balance* // This goes for all of our videos. You may realize that sometimes the 1 immortal or radiant has more money, shields, etc. Or the enemies have light shields, reduced economy, etc. This is why most of our videos are close matches. They are balanced to the teeth. This means rule-sets are set in place to create fair gameplay for everyone involved. Sometimes we do this &quot;dynamically&quot;. For example: Maybe a low ranked team would start with pistol only, then get a specter and light shield. After switching sides they maybe can full buy, etc, etc. This gives a sense of suspense to the video as the opposing team would slowly face an increasing challenge!<br /><br />#Valorant<br />#ValorantVS<br />#ValorantCurios<br />SILVER thinks he DESERVES Diamond, So I tested him<br />SILVER thinks he DESERVES Diamond, So I tested him<br />SILVER thinks he DESERVES Diamond, So I tested him{% endraw %}
