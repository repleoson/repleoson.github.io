{% raw %}Music by Father Frank Andersen a Missionary of the Sacred Heart.<br />The motto of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart is: May the Sacred Heart of Jesus be loved everywhere!<br />Strong and Constant is track 1 from the CD, Eagles Wings.<br />with love, Willemina•°*&quot;˜♥ <br /><br />&quot;Footprints in the Sand&quot;<br /><br />Last night I had a dream...<br />I dreamed I was walking along the beach with the Lord, and<br />Across the sky flashed scenes from my life.<br />For each scene I noticed two sets of footprints in the sand;<br />One belonged to me, and the other to the Lord.<br />When the last scene of my life flashed before us,<br />I looked back at the footprints in the sand.<br />I noticed that many times along the path of my life,<br />There was only one set of footprints.<br />I also noticed that it happened at the very lowest and saddest times in my life.<br />This really bothered me, and I questioned the Lord about it.<br />&quot;Lord, you said that once I decided to follow you,<br />You would walk with me all the way;<br />But I have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life,<br />There is only one set of footprints.<br />I don't understand why in times when I<br />needed you the most, you should leave me.<br />The Lord replied, &quot;My precious, precious<br />child. I love you, and I would never,<br />never leave you during your times of<br />trial and suffering.<br />When you saw only one set of footprints,<br />It was then that I carried you.&quot;{% endraw %}
