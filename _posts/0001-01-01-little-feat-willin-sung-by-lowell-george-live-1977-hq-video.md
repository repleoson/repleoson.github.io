{% raw %}Little Feat performing Willin' probably their best known song. Written by and sung here by the hugely talented and sadly missed Lowell George Live in 1977. What an amazing band they were then....such sensitivity for each others playing....great balance.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br /><br /><br />I been warped by the rain, driven by the snow<br /><br />I'm drunk and dirty, don't ya know,<br /><br />And I'm still willin'<br /><br />Out on the road late last night,<br /><br />Seen my pretty Alice in every head light<br /><br />Alice, Dallas Alice<br /><br /><br /><br />I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari<br /><br />Tehachapi to Tonapah<br /><br />Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made<br /><br />I've driven the back roads so I wouldn't get weighed<br /><br />If you give me: weed, whites, and wine<br /><br />And you show me a sign<br /><br />I'll be willin' to be movin'<br /><br /><br /><br />I've been kicked by the wind, robbed by the sleet<br /><br />Had my head stoved in, but I'm still on my feet<br /><br />And I'm still... willin'<br /><br />Now I smuggled some smokes and folks from Mexico<br /><br />Baked by the sun, every time I go to Mexico<br /><br />And I been from Tuscon to Tucumcari<br /><br />Tehachapi to Tonapah<br /><br />I've driven every kind of rig that's ever been made<br /><br />I've driven the back roads so I wouldn't get weighed<br /><br />And if you give me: weed, whites, and wine<br /><br />And you show me a sign I'll be willin' to be movin'{% endraw %}
