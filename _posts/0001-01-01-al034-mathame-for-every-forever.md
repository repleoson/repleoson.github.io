It’s a sound they have developed over their releases for Afterlife and is now truly their own. A Dub Mix of the title track offers a slightly more pared down alternative. ‘Stairway 3000’ completes the record, an eyes-down roller with a bassline to shake any room to its core.<br /><br />Mathame - For Every Forever EP (AL034)<br /><br />A For Every Forever<br />B1 For Every Forever (Dub Mix)<br />B2 Stairway 3000{% endraw %}
