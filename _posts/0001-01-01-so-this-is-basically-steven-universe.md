{% raw %}I like this show but it sure has flaws. (Sort of contains mild spoilers for Season 1 of Steven Universe)<br /><br />Thinking about doing more of these in the future if you guys like it. It's like a Welcome to except not for websites and I don't hate making it! What do you think?<br /><br />---<br /><br />Steven Universe is created by Rebecca Sugar and her team and owned by Cartoon Network. Certain backgrounds from the show were redrawn and certain moments were screenshotted for clarity.<br /><br />Music: Paper Mario: TTYD - Glitzville{% endraw %}
