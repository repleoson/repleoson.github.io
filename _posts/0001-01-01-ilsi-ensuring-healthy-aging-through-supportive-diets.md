{% raw %}As populations worldwide are aging, there are ways our society can help ensure a healthy, enjoyable and sustainable lifestyle for older individuals. The International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) will host a side event during the UN Food Systems Pre-Summit. Please join us on Monday, July 26 from 1:30 to 2:20 p.m. EDT. A panel of experts will discuss nutrition, scientific cooperation and introducing more inclusivity of older populations. Working together, we can encourage greater health, mobility and cognition for seniors.<br /><br />Encouraging scientific cooperation and research<br />Improved cooperation and integration of research will advance food scientists’ understanding of key nutrients in the aging process. Scientists can also utilize this research to design more suitable food options for older populations.<br /><br />Governments can use this research on nutrition to make informed decisions for their older populations. The collection of data can also aid in the development of food options that support healthy aging. Encouraging greater collaboration between the public and private sectors to provide more appropriate, sustainable diets for seniors can help achieve UN Sustainable Development Goals 3, 4, 9, 10, 12 and 17.<br /><br />Improving nutrition and health for seniors<br />This event will share information and host a dialogue to support improving individuals’ nutritional status and strengthening immune systems during the aging process. The discussion will also focus on the need for sustainable food system innovations, as well as more palatable, nutritious diets for seniors.<br /><br />For more information about ILSI, please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ilsi.org">https://www.ilsi.org</a>{% endraw %}
