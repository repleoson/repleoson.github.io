{% raw %}These pieces for solo guitar by Scott, Berkeley, Britten and Walton have left a permanent mark on the guitaristic landscape, expanding it to territory then unfamiliar in the prevailing aesthetic canon of Segovia. If the 20th century was the golden age in which the guitar repertoire rose to the level of that of other instruments, much of that is due to these composers.<br /><br />Composers: Benjamin Britten, Cyril Scott, Lennox Berkeley, William Walton<br />Artist: Andrea Dieci (guitar)<br /><br />üéµ Online purchase or streaming (Spotify, iTunes, Amazon Music, Deezer): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://brilliant-classics.lnk.to/EnglishGuitarBC">https://brilliant-classics.lnk.to/EnglishGuitarBC</a> <br />üíé More Information: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.brilliantclassics.com/articles/e/english-guitar-music-of-the-20th-century-berkeley-britten-scott-walton/">https://www.brilliantclassics.com/articles/e/english-guitar-music-of-the-20th-century-berkeley-britten-scott-walton/</a><br /><br />It‚Äôs easy to identify the classical guitar with Spanish repertoire. After all, Andr√©s Segovia, who revived the fortunes of the instrument in the early decades of the 20th century after long neglect, was a Spaniard. This does not do justice, however, to the major contribution made to 20th-century guitar repertoire by a number of national schools, among which the United Kingdom‚Äôs is particularly outstanding for the quantity and quality of the pieces. This album offers a significant sample of music for solo guitar by four important composers: Cyril Scott, Lennox Berkeley, Benjamin Britten and William Walton.<br /><br />Each of these four composers, though stylistically very different, took the guitar out of the salonesque environment of prettiness and quasi-exotic couleur locale and raised it to the level of other prominent concert instruments, the music being rich, challenging and holding an important place in their oeuvre.<br /><br />Played by Andrea Dieci, ‚ÄúA true star of the classical guitar‚Äù (Corriere della sera), one of the most notable guitarists of his generation. He successfully recorded for Brilliant Classics music by Henze, Takemitsu, Sor, Piazzolla, Giuliani and others.<br /><br />Tracklist:<br />Lennox Berkeley: <br />00:00:00 Quatre pi√®ces pour la guitare: I.
