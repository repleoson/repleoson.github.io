{% raw %}Today, weâ€™re going to wrap up our discussion of economic policy by looking at government regulation. We're going to talk about the government's goals for the U.S. economy and the policies it employs to achieve those goals. Ever since the New Deal, we've seen an increased role of the government within the economy - even with the deregulation initiatives of President Carter and Reagan in the 80's. Now this is all pretty controversial and we're going to talk about it, as this is a long way from the federal government handed down by the framers of the constitution. <br /><br />Produced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios">http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios</a><br /><br />Support is provided by Voqal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.voqal.org">http://www.voqal.org</a><br /><br />All attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...</a><br /><br />Want to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?<br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse">http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse">http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse</a><br />Tumblr - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com">http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com</a> <br />Support Crash Course on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/crashcourse">http://patreon.com/crashcourse</a><br /><br />CC Kids: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids">http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids</a>{% endraw %}
