{% raw %}Farkas: Moduli spaces of odd theta characteristics<br /><br />I will discuss joint work with Verra concerning a complete birational classification of the moduli space of odd spin curves of genus g. In particular, for g smaller 12, we find explicit unirational parametrizations of the moduli space, by constructing new models of the spin moduli space mirroring Mukai's well-known work on the structure of canonical curves of genus at most 9.<br /><br />The lecture was held within the framework of the Junior Hausdorff Trimester Program Algebraic Geometry.
