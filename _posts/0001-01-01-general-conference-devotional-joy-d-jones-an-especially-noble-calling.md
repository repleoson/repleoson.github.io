{% raw %}Sister Jones has so many great insights into how we can “effectively inspire our rising generation”. We as mothers, as she says, wear many hats. We need to know how to receive personal revelation to know what hat to wear and when<br /><br />We also need to know our “rightful and needful place” and receive power from the priesthood ordinances we have. <br /><br />In the video, I reference an amazing book by Melinda Wheelwright Brown called Eve and Adam Discovering the Beautiful Balance. @brave.like.eve<br /><br />I also reference my Outline For Seeking Revelation in Your Life. You can check that out at www.mbbniki.com/shop or link in my profile @mbbniki<br /><br />If you would like a copy of this study guide click here or go to the link in my profile for General Conference Study @mbbniki <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://view.flodesk.com/pages/5e8c9cbeb68c420026b65708">https://view.flodesk.com/pages/5e8c9cbeb68c420026b65708</a><br />I want to know how you increase your ability to seek personal revelation?{% endraw %}
