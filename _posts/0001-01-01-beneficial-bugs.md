{% raw %}Ninety-Nine percent of all insects are beneficial to us. They are pollinators, decomposers, predators of pests, producers of important products or food supply for other wildlife. In this class, we will discuss the many insects who are our allies and friends.<br /><br />The Hernando County Florida-Friendly Landscaping program offers classes and workshops year-round to help residents learn how to save time, money and water when maintaining their lawns and gardens.
