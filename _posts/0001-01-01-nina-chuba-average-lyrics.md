Ha<br />Say I'm savage when really, I'm just average<br />Maybe if I gave my life to money, I'd be happy<br />Dumb and dumber, martyrdumb it down for greener grasses<br />Maybe if I never tried unpacking my baggage<br />Say I'm savage when really, I'm just average<br /><br />[Verse 1]<br />I find that everyday that it gets harder to admit<br />That when the mask misfits and my stomach feels sick<br />Maybe I'm a piece of shit? (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)<br />Maybe I should just quit? (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)<br />But I reach between the dopamine to find a thread of meaning<br />Find a finer line to walk that might actually redeem<br />A little shred of positivity (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)<br />A little tiny bit of energy (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Should I cut my serotonin with a lie to make it last?<br />Should I power pose in panda face and cry, &quot;I'm never sad&quot;?<br />If I joke about the end, could I trick myself to laugh? Ha<br />Say I'm savage when really, I'm just average<br />Maybe if I gave my life to money, I'd be happy<br />Dumb and dumber, martyrdumb it down for greener grasses<br />Maybe if I never tried unpacking my baggage<br />Say I'm savage when really, I'm just average<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />I'm talkin' to you<br />Please tell me the truth<br />Please tell me what I should do?<br />Maybe my brain, it'll listen to you<br />I'm huntin' silver lines<br />But I only see them when out of my mind<br />Die for genuine smile<br />Lower than low, it could take me a while<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Should I cut my serotonin with a lie to make it last?<br />Should I power pose in panda face and cry, &quot;I'm never sad&quot;?<br />If I joke about the end, could I trick myself to laugh? Ha<br />Say I'm savage when really, I'm just average<br />Maybe if I gave my life to money, I'd be happy<br />Dumb and dumber, martyrdumb it down for greener grasses<br />Maybe if I never tried unpacking my baggage<br />Say I'm savage when really, I'm just average<br /><br />[Outro]<br />(Cut my serotonin, cut my, cut my serotonin)<br />(Power pose in panda, power, power pose in panda face)<br />(I joke about the end, joke, joke about the end)<br />(Say I'm savage when really I'm just average)<br />(Cut my serotonin, cut my, cut my serotonin)<br />(Power pose in panda, power, power pose in panda face)<br />(I joke about the end, joke, joke about the end)<br />I can't do that, I'm too insecure<br />(Say I'm savage when really I'm just average)<br /><br />.........<br />📷 Wallpaper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unsplash.com/">https://unsplash.com/</a><br />.........<br />📧 Contact / Demo Submissions: contact@7clouds.org<br />.........<br />💌 Demos / Music Submissions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com">https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com</a><br />.........<br /><br />#NinaChuba #Average #Lyrics{% endraw %}
