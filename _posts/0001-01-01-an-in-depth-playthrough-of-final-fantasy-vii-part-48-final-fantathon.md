{% raw %}Final Fantathon is our quest to casually Let's Play every mainline FF game, but FFVII is a special case. Since I have devoted over 12 years to challenge running, speed running, modding and analyzing FFVII, there is no way for me to really casually play it. So instead, we are doing an &quot;In-depth Playthrough&quot; of the game, where I talk about all of the interesting trivia, coding mechanisms, AI quirks, and lore material we as a community can think of as we go through the game. It will be an amazing ride through the game that started it all for 4-8Productions!<br /><br />Want more of us?
