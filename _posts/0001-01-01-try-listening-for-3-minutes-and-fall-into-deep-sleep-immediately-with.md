{% raw %}Slip on your headphones, close your eyes and turn off the lights. Within minutes you’ll feel like your brain is being massaged and relaxed.<br /><br />Soothing Delta frequencies, associated with deep restorative sleep, ease your brain out of the rapid rhythms of Beta, down through the relaxing states of Alpha and Theta, into the welcoming depths of Delta.  As your brain cells resonate with Delta binaural beats, you start to slowly swirl and drift. Pestering concerns are washed away, allowing you to fall into deep sleep states that bring the refreshing slumber your body and mind need for optimum performance.<br />meditationrelaxclub<br />Nhạc sóng não chính gốc Hùng Eker<br />Soothing Relaxation<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />If you find any copyright issues, please contact me via hungeker@gmail.com<br />I will reply immediately!<br />Thank you!{% endraw %}
