{% raw %}This episode we're back in the ThunderFab workshop.<br />Everything has come back from the powder coaters and its looking so good. We remove the old canopy, bolt on the new canopy with the flares, toolboxes and light panels. <br /><br />It all gets wired up, spare wheel mounted and mudflaps are fitted.<br /><br />Both canopies are smoked out to replicate water/dust ingress and their both weighed - results were awesome!<br /><br />The boys have built a canopy that's stronger (engineered to handle my 110kg tinny on top), dust/water proof and yet still comes in LIGHTER than my old import.<br /><br />Follow ThunderFab on socials;<br />www.instagram.com/thunder.fab<br />www.facebook.com/Thunderfab<br /><br />OR start planning your own build (weights/prices/sizes are all here);<br />www.thunderfab.com.au<br /><br />Cheers!<br />Cam, Tiff and Chloe,<br />wildtouring1@gmail.com<br /><br />To get your own Wild Touring merchandise check out our online shop - www.wildtouring.com.au<br /><br />HUGE thank you to all our new Patrons!
