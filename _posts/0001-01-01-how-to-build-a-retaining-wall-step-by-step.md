{% raw %}Like the flagstone patio? Here's how I built it -  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/oPDW1xQ7_SE">https://youtu.be/oPDW1xQ7_SE</a><br />List of tools and materials and more details - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.handymanstartup.com/build-retaining-wall/">https://www.handymanstartup.com/build-retaining-wall/</a><br /><br />In this video I show you exactly how to build a retaining wall with landscape blocks.<br />You'll learn how to design your retaining wall, the tools you need, how to build it step by step, and even some retaining wall design ideas.<br /><br />First, I'll walk you through how to design your retaining wall, and the critical components you need to include so your retaining wall doesn't fail. Things like proper drainage, a solid base material, and making sure you dig deep enough so the retaining wall doesn't fall over.<br /><br />Most people skip critical steps, like digging deep enough for a 6&quot; packed gravel base - which is critical for the structural integrity of your wall. Or, even worse, they don't install a gravel base at all.<br /><br />You'll also learn the importance of using 3/4&quot; gravel behind your retaining wall blocks so excess moisture doesn't build up behind the wall and potentially cause it to fall over. <br /><br />Then, I'll demonstrate how wide to dig the trench before building your wall, and what to consider when planning that out. In this video I built a curved wall with a cool step feature.<br /><br />Then, we'll go right into building it, starting with the first row of blocks., which you'll need to make sure are perfectly level. I'll share some tips (use sand) for making this much easier so you can save time.<br /><br />This home improvement project will have a dramatic impact on your landscape, and it doesn't cost that much. In fact, this 50' long wall, that is 3' tall, only cost me about $1,000 in materials total.  That's pretty amazing considering the transformation it made to my backyard.<br /><br />I think you'll like this video, because it includes a time-lapse of building the wall as well - so you can get an idea of exactly how much work goes into installing a retaining wall - which is a lot!<br /><br />---About Handyman Startup ---------------------------<br />Handyman Startup is a website designed to help you turn your DIY skills into a profitable handyman business.
