Forget<br />B1. Boxed Off<br />B2. Schwicked<br /><br />Hot on the heels of his smash hit 'Get Beasty' EP released in February this year, Hot Creations favourite Patrick Topping is back with another superb release in the running to be his most successful yet! The 'Boxed Off' EP features three dance floor bombs, just as we've come to expect from talented youngster, all with that signature Patrick Topping sound yet each completely unique. 'Forget' is potentially his biggest track yet, a staple of Jamie's current sets it's truly infectious and set to be feature heavily at WMC this year. 'Boxed Off' is menacing, rumbling &amp; dark heads-down affair whilst 'Schwicked' is another hooky as hell bomb from Patrick. Another killer three track EP from Patrick Topping, who seems like he can do no wrong at the moment!<br /><br />Patrick Topping impressed us all with his debut EP 'Walk On', with his tracks being championed by Jamie Jones, Lee Foss and the Hot Creations crew. His next EP 'Any Amounts' was one of the biggest releases of the year for Hot Creations. More recently his 'Get Beasty' EP was released, receiving masses of support including regular plays on Radio 1 from the likes of Annie Mac and Pete Tong who crowned him as a 'Future Star' on his show.<br /><br />Alongside releases on his home label Hot Creations he has a track coming out on the Defected Miami CD and remixes on the way for Circus Recordings and Resonance Records.<br /><br />For more information on Patrick Topping, see below: <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Patrick-Topping/543739625648970">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Patrick-Topping/543739625648970</a><br />SoundCloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/patricktopping">https://soundcloud.com/patricktopping</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Patrick_Topping">https://twitter.com/Patrick_Topping</a><br />R.A.: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/patricktopping">http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/patricktopping</a><br />Beatport: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.beatport.com/artist/patrick-topping/332183">http://www.beatport.com/artist/patrick-topping/332183</a><br /><br />For more information on Hot Creations, see below:<br /><br />Subscribe on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://hotcreations.com/youtube-subscribe">http://hotcreations.com/youtube-subscribe</a><br />Hot Creations Facebook Page - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://hotcreations.com/facebook-like">http://hotcreations.com/facebook-like</a><br />Hot Creations Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://hotcreations.com/twitter-follow">http://hotcreations.com/twitter-follow</a><br />Hot Creations site - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://hotcreations.com">http://hotcreations.com</a><br />Hot Creations SoundCloud - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/hot-creations">https://soundcloud.com/hot-creations</a>{% endraw %}
