{% raw %}Get a copy of Mel's new book, The High 5 Habit. It will teach you a simple way to take control and feel more confident, no matter what is going on around you... ðŸ˜‰. You can pre-order your copy at High5Habit.com. <br />--------<br />Looking for your passion? If you find it, congrats! For many, the idea of searching for your passion causes more stress and concern over the future than necessary. Truth is, the things that energize you are going to change frequently and over time. What energized me today won't necessarily energize me next week. <br /><br />So, instead of trying to FIND a passion or a purpose, stay tuned to what ENERGIZES you. <br /><br />This is a clip from my episode of Leaders Create Leaders with the incredible Gerard Adams.
