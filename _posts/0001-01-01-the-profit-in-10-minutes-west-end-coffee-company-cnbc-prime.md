In each one-hour episode of The Profit, Lemonis makes an offer that’s impossible to refuse; his cash for a piece of the business and a percentage of the profits. And once inside these companies, he’ll do almost anything to save the business and make himself a profit; even if it means firing the president, promoting the secretary or doing the work himself.<br /><br />About CNBC Prime: By night, CNBC Prime is an entertainment network with a programming slate that is an extension of CNBC’s distinct brand.
