Get ready for this back to school 2019 season!<br /><br />Transitioning from high school to college is probably one of the hardest things you’ll do in your life. I wanted to give you a real rundown of what the first week of college is actually like. In this video I talk about frosh week, move in day, classes, how to make friends, college parties, roommates, and much more! I think a lot of you might be intimidated by the fact that everything is new, and you don’t know anyone. So you’re scared that you’re not going to make friends in college. But after watching this video, you’ll know what to expect in your first week so now you’re going to be okay. I don’t want you to be a lost little freshman. You’re going to start off strong. I believe in you!{% endraw %}
