{% raw %}Hey guys, it's me. ShiroBrawl, this has to be one of my most closet and intense match yet. the results of how I kept myself alive is extremely impressive that I'm proud of myself, this also shows it's possible to beat Tetris players who can move at the speed of light. Yes I will admit, there were some luck but that'll always happen when I'm playing, however hopefully I'll encounter top of worldwide again, I had a ton of fun playing with him/her. I hope you enjoy this video!{% endraw %}
