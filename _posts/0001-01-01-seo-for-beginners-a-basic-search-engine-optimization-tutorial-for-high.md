By definition, it is the process of optimizing your website and webpages to get “free”, “organic” traffic from search engines like Google, Yahoo and Bing.<br /><br />As a business owner, blogger, or website owner, your job is two-fold: <br /><br />First, you need to make it easy for search engines to understand what your page is about and create content that matches what we call, the “searcher’s intent.” <br /><br />Second, you need to show Google and other search engines that your pages are ‘worthy’ of ranking.<br /><br />In this video, Sam Oh teaches the a 101 into the world of search engine optimization.<br /><br />There are plenty of clear examples and some basic (yet powerful) SEO tips to optimize a brand new website to rank #1 on Google (step-by-step).<br /><br />The techniques that are taught in this SEO training include: <br /><br />1. Keyword research <br />By doing keyword research, you can see the average number of times someone searches for a specific keyword phrase in Google each month.<br /><br />Often times, the query that you think will be the most popular is often far from the truth.<br /><br />Using tools like Ahrefs Keywords Explorer (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer),">https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer),</a> you’ll learn how to use the “parent topic” of a term to determine the best keywords to target for your pages.<br /><br />You’ll also learn what not to do (ie. keyword stuffing). <br /><br />Keyword research gives you clues on the language you should use to let both Google and potential customers know what our page is about.<br /><br />There are a few vivid examples in here to illustrate the best practices on how to do keyword research. If you want to sharpen your keyword research skills, I highly recommend watching this series on doing keyword research in 2018 and beyond. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zLBu_NfOaQ&amp;list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tIF-QrFD854Mnb8D4Av5vx">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zLBu_NfOaQ&amp;list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tIF-QrFD854Mnb8D4Av5vx</a><br /><br />2.

Off-page SEO<br />Off-page SEO is often referred to as link building.<br /><br />Link building is the process of getting other websites to link to your web pages. <br /><br />Basically, links act as “votes” or other people vouching for your website.<br /><br />Backlinks work in a similar way that you would refer your friend to buy a product from your favorite store because you’ve tried it, used it, and loved it.<br /><br />In general, the more quality backlinks you can get from relevant pages, the higher you’ll rank in Google.<br /><br />Sam will show you how to find backlink opportunities and the key technique that SEOs use to build links, which is through email outreach.<br /><br />I highly recommend watching our video series on competitor backlink analysis and link building here: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io4ugroDedo&amp;list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2vQNygbg5Uo1sMDs8aqRc4z">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io4ugroDedo&amp;list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2vQNygbg5Uo1sMDs8aqRc4z</a><br /><br />We also have another playlist on more &quot;advanced&quot; link building. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovu2ZYWgOJQ&amp;list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovu2ZYWgOJQ&amp;list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m</a><br /><br />There’s a lot to learn with SEO marketing and we're constantly adding new tutorials to help you learn and execute SEO in effective ways.<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />1:18 What is SEO?<br />2:43 Find keywords that are relevant to your niche<br />5:56 Optimize title tags and meta-descriptions<br />11:00 Do Off-page SEO<br />12:12 Use outreach and guest-posting to build links<br />15:44 Start a blog and create useful content<br />18:30 Pick topics that provide value to your business<br /><br />Be sure to subscribe for more actionable tutorials and grow your SEO and marketing knowledge.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />STAY TUNED:<br />Ahrefs ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ahrefs.com/">https://ahrefs.com/</a><br />YouTube ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />Facebook ►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Ahrefs">https://www.facebook.com/Ahrefs</a><br />Twitter ►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ahrefs">https://twitter.com/ahrefs</a><br /><br />#SEO #SearchEngineOptimization #SEOTutorial{% endraw %}
