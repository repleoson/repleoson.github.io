{% raw %}Johnny Cash - General Lee Dukes of Hazzard Soundtrack<br /><br />For everyone who thinks that Dukes of Hazzard wasted a lot of Chargers, think about this for a second. In 1968 and 1969 Chrysler produced about 180.000 Dodge Chargers. That's a hundred-and-eighty-THOUSAND! They used 321 of them on Dukes. That's less than 0.5%. Now with that in mind, think of how populair the Charger has become because of the show. There are still thousands of restored cars left all over the world. Cars that are preserved because the Charger has become so populair. Cars that otherwise would have rotten away in some junkyard in the last 50 years. So I think it's safe to say that Dukes of Hazzard was actually a GOOD thing to happen to Dodge's Charger.{% endraw %}
