This allows you to perfectly define where your brow should start and end, based on your own facial symmetry. Likewise, when properly shaped, brows provide symmetry for every face also. Brow mapping allows your nose to appear slimmer and your eyes and facial features become more balanced. Don't forget that proportion is everything--brow mapping almost always improves your entire look!<br /><br />Find the link to purchase our Painting Line Bow Arrow Ruler for easy and effortless brow mapping below: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://supercilium.com/products/brow-bow">https://supercilium.com/products/brow-bow</a><br /><br /><br /><br />L E T S   C O N N E C T :<br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/supercilium...">https://www.instagram.com/supercilium...</a><br />Pinterest - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/supercilium...">https://www.pinterest.com/supercilium...</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/supercilium/">https://www.facebook.com/supercilium/</a><br />LinkedIn - Supercilium Brow Henna<br />Web: www.supercilium.com/ <br /><br />Visit our site for more info and to shop our Brow Henna, Brow Glaze, and more soon!<br /><br />Tags: <br />browlamination, lamination, brows, eyebrows, beauty, makeup, browlift, brow lift, brow lamination<br />browglaze, brow glaze, training, supercilium, supercilium brow henna, how to, how-to brow lamination, brow botox, beautiful brows, brow trends, tinting, browmapping, brow mapping, mapping{% endraw %}
