{% raw %}The Number of The Beast, Run To The Hills, and Fear of The Dark Orchestral Medley.<br /><br />Do you want to be in the next epic video? send a DM to: www.instagram.com/mickytejada_<br /><br />After endless sleepless nights, after countless hours of editing, I finally finished a new symphonic video dedicated to Iron Maiden. It is a new version of a previously published symphonic medley that includes the songs Fear of The Dark, The Number of The Beast, and Run to The Hills. It was recorded from a concert we gave just before the closure of activities and like the old times, the orchestra is massive and epic. The video and the music are edited in a way that you will feel like you are watching everything from your seat at the theater. <br /><br /><br />Line-Up: <br />Conductor: Javier Fernandez Prada. <br />Orchestra: &quot;Orquesta Sinfónica de Chancay&quot;. <br />Timpani: Rodrigo Nuñez Melgar. <br />Drums: Hans Menacho. <br />Bass: Fabrizzio Huertas. <br />Guitar: Micky Tejada. <br />Orchestral Arrangements by Micky Tejada.<br />Produced by Micky Tejada. <br /><br />Recorded at the &quot;Teatro Municipal de Lima&quot;, 2019. <br /><br />Bussiness comunications to: epicsymphonicrock@gmail.com <br /><br />#epicsymphonicrock #ironmaiden #orchestra{% endraw %}
