{% raw %}Es sind zween Weg in dieser Zeit (Ausbund Hymn No. 125)<br /><br />There are two ways, in this, our day, One narrow and the other broad;<br />Who now will go the narrow way Will be despised by all abroad.<br />This plainly God’s word teaches us, The narrow entrance way go in;<br />Straight is the gate, who enters thus, Must first endure great suffering.<br /><br />There—after, there’s eternal rest, Therefore, O man, Thy way prepare;<br />Wilt thou be in God’s kingdom blessed Eternally with righteous there.<br />After this time nought shall transpire But peace and joy eternally;<br />The righteous then, this shall acquire Who God’s will honor constantly.<br /><br />But he who the broad way shall go, The stairs to hell, this is the same;<br />He now is lost, God’s wrath shall know, But blessed is he who’s born again.<br />To him hath God prepared, impearled A crown eternity shall hold;<br />It shall not pass away, O world, Away then, with your gain and gold.<br /><br />O, take the straight and narrow way That thou the lasting crown obtain;<br />Which God doth but His church convey Which He hath cleansed from sin and stain.<br />Therefore away with all man’s gain, Desire, vain pomp, and arrogance;<br />Turn sharp away from all known sin, So thou be known as God’s child hence.<br /><br />Nought other can the way become, Who will eternal suffering flee;<br />Must righteous be, this is the sum, Go on your way, nor fancy see.<br />Press toward the mark till endless day, For who the prize at last will gain;<br />All must forsake upon this way Would he the lasting crown obtain.<br /><br />(This song can be found in the hymnal 'Christian Hymnary' and in the CD 'Anabaptist Martyr Hymns' recorded by the Overholt Family.
