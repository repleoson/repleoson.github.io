{% raw %}Quick announcement! I’m working on building an online platform that will help you to easily create and maintain your estate plan -- if you’d like to get early access or learn more once we’re ready, fill out the 3 question form by clicking on the link below: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wic4exomah8.typeform.com/to/dRZJAqFQ">https://wic4exomah8.typeform.com/to/dRZJAqFQ</a><br /><br />Some people keep their estate distribution simple by leaving their entire estate equally to certain heirs - the children, for example.<br /><br />While others want to leave either a specific sum of money to certain people, or they want to leave a percentage of their estate to certain individuals or charities.<br /><br />So which is better? A specific sum or a percentage of the estate?<br /><br />When you leave a specific amount of money to specific people, it's simple and easy to comprehend. But the problem is that you do not know if you will be spending the bulk of your estate during your lifetime, and if, when you die, your entire estate is consumed by satisfying the specific amount distributions, then the remainder beneficiaries will be left out in the cold.<br /><br />But if you leave a percentage of the estate to everyone that is included, then that can eliminate the risk of your estate valuation fluctuating wildly. But if you leave everyone a percentage of your estate, it is likely that those beneficiaries, whether they are individuals or charities, will likely want to scrutinize estate accountings and estate valuations so that they can satisfy themselves that they are receiving the appropriate amount.<br /><br />For prospective law firm clients who want to schedule a free 30 minute initial phone call with Paul Rabalais, go to: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.oncehub.com/Paul8">https://go.oncehub.com/Paul8</a><br /><br />This post is for informational purposes only and does not provide legal advice.
