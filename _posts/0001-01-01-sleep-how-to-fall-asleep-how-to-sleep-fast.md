{% raw %}Sleep. This video is on how to fall asleep, sleep fast, sleep better, sleeping tips, sleep well and to fall asleep fast.<br /><br />This weeks video on how to fall asleep, I've received a lot of messages and comments to make a video on this topic and now it's finally ready. I really hope my tips help you and always remember you’re awesome!<br /><br />HOW MUCH SLEEP DO WE NEED:<br />Most adults need around 8 hours of good-quality sleep a night to function properly – but some need more and some less. What matters is that you find out how much sleep you need and then try to achieve it.<br /><br />As a general rule, if you wake up tired and spend the day longing for a chance to have a nap, it's likely that you're not getting enough sleep.<br /><br />A variety of factors can cause poor sleep, including health conditions such as sleep apnoea. But in most cases, it's due to bad sleeping habits.<br /><br />Find out the common medical causes of fatigue: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sleep-and-tiredness/10-medical-reasons-for-feeling-tired/">https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sleep-and-tiredness/10-medical-reasons-for-feeling-tired/</a><br /><br />WHY SLEEP IS SO GOOD FOR US:<br />Sleep boosts immunity<br />If you seem to catch every cold and flu that's going around, your bedtime could be to blame. Prolonged lack of sleep can disrupt your immune system, so you're less able to fend off bugs.<br /><br />Sleep can slim you<br />Sleeping less may mean you put on weight! Studies have shown that people who sleep less than 7 hours a day tend to gain more weight and have a higher risk of becoming obese than those who get 7 hours of slumber.<br /><br />Sleep boosts mental wellbeing<br />Given that a single sleepless night can make you irritable and moody the following day, it's not surprising that chronic sleep debt may lead to long-term mood disorders like depression and anxiety.<br /><br />When people with anxiety or depression were surveyed to calculate their sleeping habits, it turned out that most of them slept for less than 6 hours a night.<br /><br />Sleep prevents diabetes<br />Studies have suggested that people who usually sleep less than 5 hours a night have an increased risk of developing diabetes.<br /><br />It seems that missing out on deep sleep may lead to type 2 diabetes by changing the way the body processes glucose, which the body uses for energy.<br /><br />Sleep wards off heart disease<br />Long-standing sleep deprivation seems to be associated with increased heart rate, an increase in blood pressure and higher levels of certain chemicals linked with inflammation, which may put extra strain on your heart.<br /><br />HOW TO FALL ASLEEP TIPS:<br />In this video I have included six of my top tips that everyone should be doing to help us fall asleep better and faster.

Treating any underlying condition that is causing the problem, if possible, can help to promote sleep. In particular, depression and anxiety are common causes of poor sleep and can often be treated.<br /><br />For more information please visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/insomnia/">https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/insomnia/</a><br /><br /><br />Want to see more videos about everything health and pharmacy?
