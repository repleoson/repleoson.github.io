THE ORIGINAL BLACKâ€™S BARBECUE <br />SOCIAL: @blacksbbq<br />WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.blacksbbq.com/">https://www.blacksbbq.com/</a><br />ADDRESS: 215 North Main Street, Lockhart, Texas 78644<br />OPERATION HOURS: Sun - Thurs 10AM - 8PM | Fri - Sat 10AM - 8:30PM<br /><br />The Original Blackâ€™s Barbecue is the oldest in Texas, run by the same family since 1932. 3rd Generation Pitmaster Kent Black slow smokes all Barbecue the way his grandfather did in 1932. A simple rub, local Post Oak Wood and patience is the secret. Their brisket is truly legendary. <br /><br />ðŸ¤¤ HOMEMADE SAUSAGE: Blackâ€™s BBQâ€™s 80 year old recipe and techniques remain the same as each ring is hand stuffed and hand tied, then smoked to perfection. Take the brisket trimmings and chop them up, then place them in a mixer. Along with the chopped meat, add the mixture (salt, pepper, and a flour based binder) and water. Fine grind it so it comes out looking almost like hamburger meat. Pour into the stuffer. Stuff the casings with ground meat. Cut and tie them. Place in the smoker and allow them to smoke for about an hour. <br /><br />ðŸ’¸PRICE: $3.99 per ring<br /><br />ðŸ¥© BRISKET: Take raw brisket and trim off the fat. Begin by cutting some of the lean end off (this meat is used for sausage). Trim off the edges to make it round and make it more aerodynamic, which helps give the brisket less chance to burn. Cut off 2/3 of the hard fat. Continue trimming. Add Blacks secret seasoning, which includes special salt and pepper, red pepper, cayenne and secrets, and massage into the fibers of the meat. Place the raw brisket in the smoker and allow it to smoke for 6 hours. After the first cook, let the meat rest by removing the brisket and placing it in a walk-in cooler to dry-age for a few days. After dry-aging, itâ€™s time for the second cook. Place the brisket back in the smoker for another roughly 6 hours, until your brisket is mouth-wateringly perfect. Donâ€™t forget to enjoy it with Blackâ€™s infamous Norma Jeanâ€™s Original BBQ Sauce! <br /><br />ðŸ’¸PRICE: $22.99 per pound<br /><br />#BestEverUSATour #BestEverFoodReviewShow #BEFRS<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />ðŸ’¬COME SAY HI:<br />INSTAGRAM Â» <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BestEverInstagram">http://bit.ly/BestEverInstagram</a> (@besteverfoodreviewshow)<br />FACEBOOK Â» <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebook">http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebook</a><br /> <br />ðŸ’—SUPPORT OUR MISSION:<br />Patreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. <br /> <br />If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture. <br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />ðŸŽ¬CREDITS:<br />HOST Â» Sonny Side <br />DP Â» Tony Sylvers <br />CAMERA OPERATOR Â» Dylan Johnson <br />VIDEO EDITOR Â» Ngoc Le Hong<br />PRODUCER Â» Liz Peterson <br />PRODUCTION COORDINATOR  Â» Khoi Chung<br />COLOR &amp; MASTER Â» QuÃ­ Nguyá»…n<br /> <br />Selected tracks via Audio Network <br />For business inquiries: marketing@befrs.com{% endraw %}
