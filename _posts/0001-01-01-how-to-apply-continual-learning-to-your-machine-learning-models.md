{% raw %}Leah Kolben, CTO of cnvrg.io talks about continual learning of machine learning models at Data Science Salon Miami. Academics and practitioners alike believe that continual learning (CL) is a fundamental step towards artificial intelligence. Continual learning is the ability of a model to learn continually from a stream of data. In practice, this means supporting the ability of a model to autonomously learn and adapt in production as new data comes in. The idea of CL is to mimic humans ability to continually acquire, fine-tune, and transfer knowledge and skills throughout their lifespan. CL of models in production will improve accuracy, and bring artificial intelligence one step closer to real human intelligence. <br />In this presentation, Leah Kolben will give a detailed explanation of why CL is important, how it improves model accuracy, and how to implement CL in practice using TensorFlow, Kubernetes and cnvrg.io. Key takeaways include:<br />* Understanding of Continual Learning<br />* Optimizing for accuracy with CL<br />* How to use TensorFlow to apply CL<br />* How to make automatically adaptive machine learning<br />    * Adapting to shifting data distributions<br />    * Coping with outliers<br />    * Retraining in production<br />    * Adapting to new tasks <br />* Deploying ML pipeline to production{% endraw %}
