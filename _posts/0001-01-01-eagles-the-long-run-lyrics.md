{% raw %}Eagles - The Long Run Lyrics<br />I used to hurry a lot, I used to worry a lot<br />I used to stay out till the break of day<br />Oh, that didn't get it,<br />It was high time I quit it<br />I just couldn't carry on that way<br />Oh, I did some damage, I know it's true<br />Didn't know I was so lonely , till I found you<br />You can go the distance<br />We'll find out in the long run<br />(in the long run)<br />We can handle some resistance<br />If our love is a strong one (is a strong one)<br />People talkin' about is<br />They got nothin' else to do<br />When it all comes down we will<br />Still come through<br />In the long run<br />Ooh, I want to tell you, it's a long run<br />You know I don't understand why you don't<br />Treat yourself better<br />Do the crazy things that you do<br />'cause all the debutantes in houston, baby,<br />Couldn't hold a candle to you<br />Did you do it for love?<br />Did you do it for money?<br />Did you do it for spite?<br />Did you think you had to, honey?<br />Who is gonna make it?<br />We'll find out in the long run<br />(in the long run)<br />I know we can take it<br />If our love is a strong one<br />(is a strong one)<br />Well, we're scared, but we ain't shakin'<br />Kinda bent, but we ain't breakin'<br />In the long run<br />Ooh, I want to tell you, it's a long run<br />In the long run<br />In the long run, etc...{% endraw %}
