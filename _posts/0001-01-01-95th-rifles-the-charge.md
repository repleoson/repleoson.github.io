{% raw %}This scene was created and filmed on a sunny Sunday afternoon at Euston Hall in Suffolk. <br /><br /><br /><br />I have plans to incorporate this sequence into a much larger project in the future.<br /><br /><br /><br />This short clip could never have been achieved without the dedication of all involved and the comradery that runs between the first and second battalions of the 95th Rifles - both of which have my sincerest thanks.{% endraw %}
