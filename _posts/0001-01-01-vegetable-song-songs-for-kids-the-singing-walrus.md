Each verse introduces 3 vegetables in a fun call and response form that is easy for kids to follow. In each chorus, everyone sings along to the lines &quot;Vegetables for you! Vegetables for me! Vegetables for you and me!&quot; <br /><br />Teachers can use this video as a fun supplement for teaching fruits and vegetables in the classroom. Perfect for both native English speakers and young students of ESL/EFL!<br /><br />Buy the mp3 of this song here:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/vegetable-song-single/1287314559">https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/vegetable-song-single/1287314559</a><br /><br />Here are the lyrics:<br /><br />(intro 1) <br />Carrot!<br />Cabbage!<br />Broccoli!<br />One, two, three!<br /><br />(verse 1)<br />Let’s chop some carrots (carrots), na, na, na<br />Let’s chop some cabbage (cabbage), na, na, na<br />Let’s chop some broccoli (broccoli), na, na, na<br />Some vegetables for you and me<br /><br />Carrot!
