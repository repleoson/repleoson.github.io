{% raw %}As we mark our 10th anniversary, the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) is proud to share this new short film showcasing the AHRC’s first decade - and looking ahead to our next one.  <br /><br />In this film we see and hear from AHRC staff members who share their thoughts and reflections on role of the AHRC, the research we fund, and the social, cultural, and economic benefits that the research brings.  <br /><br />This film sees us delving beneath our corporate persona to speak from the heart about who we are, what we do, and why it’s important. <br /><br />This film demonstrates how arts and humanities research is helping shape modern understanding of the world we live in, and how it makes a significant impact to our everyday lives.{% endraw %}
