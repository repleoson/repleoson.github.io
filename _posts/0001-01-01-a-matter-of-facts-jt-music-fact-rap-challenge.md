{% raw %}So the awesome JT Music put out a challenge to make a rap out of interesting trivia... And that's the sort of thing I just can't resist! So here's my rebuttal. It was certainly a refreshing break from ink demons and cuddly death robots!<br /><br />I tried my best to keep the facts as varied and interesting as possible, with a mix of weird things I've heard over the years, new ones I discovered for this track and a couple I researched and found out myself. (I spent a LOT of time counting Forts...)<br />So hopefully there's something interesting in here for all of you!<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Check out the full Stupendium originals playlist for all of my original songs!<br /><br />STUPENDIUM ORIGINALS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVVOXbE6Ls1glsfzH9tldq-KqPI-g84LA">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVVOXbE6Ls1glsfzH9tldq-KqPI-g84LA</a><br /><br />THE STUPENDIUM ON SPOTIFY:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Stupendify">http://bit.ly/Stupendify</a><br /><br />THE STUPENDIUM ON GOOGLE PLAY:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/StuGooglium">http://bit.ly/StuGooglium</a><br /><br />THE STUPENDIUM ON iTUNES:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/StupendiTunes">http://bit.ly/StupendiTunes</a><br /><br />Lyrics, Vocals and video all by The Stupendium!<br />Beats by Oxygen Beats!<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Grab your official Stupendium Merchandise!
