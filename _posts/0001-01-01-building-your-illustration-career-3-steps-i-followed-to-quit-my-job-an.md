{% raw %}Thinking on how to become a full time artist? Or simply starting your career in illustration. In this video I share the 3 steps I followed to quit my job to become an illustrator that might help you when building your illustration career or when working as a freelance illustrator. <br /><br />This is my first video upload and itâ€™s all about my path into starting with illustration. Iâ€™m also including some tips or steps I went through that I think might be helpful if someone is thinking of having a creative business or thinking about how to start. I cover a bit of different ways to make money as an illustrator at the beginning.<br /><br />Get the Procreate brushes &amp; color palettes I use in my art! <br />ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gumroad.com/asiaorlando_">https://gumroad.com/asiaorlando_</a><br /><br />In the video I share a bit of my background as well, where I studied illustration &amp; Arts, something about how I managed to achieve financial stability to a point where I was able to earn enough from my illustration and quit my job at that time (I also talk a bit about the topics of my future videos) <br /><br />I would love to have your feedback. I know thereâ€™s a lot of room for improvement but also, I would love to know if thereâ€™s something you might want to ask or see in future videos.<br /><br />Follow me on! <br />âž¦Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/asiaorlando_/">https://www.instagram.com/asiaorlando_/</a><br />âž¦Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/orlandoasia_">https://twitter.com/orlandoasia_</a><br />âž¦Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/asiaorlando_">https://www.patreon.com/asiaorlando_</a><br />âž¦SubStack: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://asiaorlando.substack.com/">https://asiaorlando.substack.com/</a><br /><br />Feeling like supporting my channel, check out the following:<br />âž¦Shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.asiaorlando.com/shop">https://www.asiaorlando.com/shop</a><br />âž¦All the gear for my YouTube Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kit.co/orlandopedro">https://kit.co/orlandopedro</a><br />âž¦The Music in my videos is from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/TGMgKkT">https://geni.us/TGMgKkT</a><br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ YouTube Video &amp; Edit by: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/orlandopedro_">https://www.instagram.com/orlandopedro_</a><br /><br />The tools that I use to work on my art:<br />âž¦ Canon Pixma Printer on Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/ABXZYAa">https://geni.us/ABXZYAa</a> <br />âž¦ iPad Pro on Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/CPgX5">https://geni.us/CPgX5</a> <br />âž¦ Apple Pencil  on Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/NlQTDJ">https://geni.us/NlQTDJ</a>      <br />âž¦ Procreate 5 â€“ to illustrate, it's my favorite go-to app (personal and client work).<br /><br />The Paper I use for Printing Artwork and My Illustrations:<br />âž¦ Staples Ultra Premium A3+ on Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/rcAQq17">https://geni.us/rcAQq17</a><br />âž¦ Staples Ultra Premium Letter on Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/faeQQ">https://geni.us/faeQQ</a>        <br />âž¦ Canon Matt Paper A4 on Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/dYxUrFB">https://geni.us/dYxUrFB</a>    <br /><br />Check out my other videos:<br />â—‰ Procreate Tutorial for Beginners: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/EKL_D5GTA_8">https://youtu.be/EKL_D5GTA_8</a> <br />â—‰ 170+ FREE PROCREATE BRUSHES: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/xP87fBaVZ6Q">https://youtu.be/xP87fBaVZ6Q</a><br />â—‰ PASSIVE INCOME for Artists - Is it worth it? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/w8GYkUGfaE4">https://youtu.be/w8GYkUGfaE4</a><br />â—‰ Build your Online Art &amp; Illustration Portfolio: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/SHvoLraJbNY">https://youtu.be/SHvoLraJbNY</a><br />â—‰ Procreate Tutorial for Beginners: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/EKL_D5GTA_8">https://youtu.be/EKL_D5GTA_8</a> <br />â—‰ How I print my artwork: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/iVe-CM7SuT0">https://youtu.be/iVe-CM7SuT0</a><br />â—‰ ETSY For Artists: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/w-7mec7JKNg">https://youtu.be/w-7mec7JKNg</a><br />â—‰ Social Media for Artists: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/BXgYpJQlfuk">https://youtu.be/BXgYpJQlfuk</a><br />â—‰ How I became an illustrator: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/lGxq-m05F2A">https://youtu.be/lGxq-m05F2A</a><br />â—‰ Illustration Tutorial about how to use color: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9L1jdEMJBXs">https://youtu.be/9L1jdEMJBXs</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This video description contains affiliate links, meaning that if you click on one of the product links and buy something, Iâ€™ll receive a small commission (no extra cost for you).
