{% raw %}AMAZING ART TUTORIALS AND IDEAS YOU SHOULD TRY<br /><br /><br /><br />Are you looking to unleash your creative side? Well, in this video I show you some amazing tricks and hacks to help you become a better artist. Not only will these tips improve your art skills, but they’ll also help you experiment and find out which style suits you. <br /><br />For starters, you can add some glue on an eggshell and sprinkle some quarks to it. Then, add warm water in a glass bowl, add some food coloring, and some more quarks in the bowl and you’re all set.<br /><br />Another experiment you can try is the cotton candy vs water. You can add the cotton candy in water and then let it become liquid. <br /><br />I show you how to use glitter in your paints and some epoxy resin to create beautiful decorations for your home. One is to pour some glitter in some epoxy resin, mix it up and then pour the paint on round canvas to give some color to your room. <br /><br />I also show you how to use Coptic markers and to dry out some doodles for your bullet journal. <br /><br /><br /><br />Timestamps: <br /><br />0:31 – How to grow crystals on an eggshell<br /><br />3:19 – Satisfying paint hacks<br /><br />4:51 – Amazing tricks using markers<br /><br />6:22 – Color changing doodles you should try<br /><br />8:34 – Glitter ideas you should try<br /><br />9:53 – Paint splatter painting <br /><br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
