No<br />Any time I see you, let me know<br />But I planted that seed, just let me grow<br />I'm on my knees while I'm beggin'<br />'Cause I don't want to lose you<br />Hey yeah, ratatata<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />I'm beggin', beggin' you<br />And put your loving hand out baby<br />I'm beggin', beggin' you<br />And put your loving hand out darlin'<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />I need you to understand<br />Tried so hard to be your man<br />The kind of man you want in the end<br />Only then can I begin to live again<br /><br />An empty shell<br />I used to be<br />The shadow of my life<br />Was hangin over me<br />A broken man<br />But I don't know<br />Won't even stand the devil's dance<br />To win my soul<br /><br />[Verse 3]<br />What we doin'? What we chasin'?<br />What about 'em, why the basement?<br />Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?<br />Why the feel for the need to replace me?<br />You on a runway track from the good<br />I want to paint in the pictures any way we could, react<br />Like the heart in a trash where you should<br />You done gave it away, ya' had it till you took it back<br />But I keep walkin' on<br />Keep rockin' dawns<br />Keep walking forward<br />Now the court is yours<br />Keep browsin' halls<br />'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home<br />Girl I'm beggin'<br /><br />Thanks For Watching<br /><br />#TikToksong{% endraw %}
