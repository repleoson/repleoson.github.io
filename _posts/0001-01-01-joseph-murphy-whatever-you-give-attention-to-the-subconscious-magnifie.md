For let us not suppose that even the highest powers will take us out of the law of cause and effect. We can never set any cause in motion without calling forth those effects which it already contains in embryo and which will again become causes in their turn, thus producing a series which must continue to flow on until it is cut short by bringing into operation a cause of an opposite character to the one which originated it.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;but there is a fourth mental condition, which is that of letting our mental functions run on without our will directing them to any definite purpose. It is on this word purpose that we must fix our whole attention; and instead of dissipating our energies, we must follow an intelligent method of concentration. The word means being gathered up at a centre, and the centre of anything is that point in which all its forces are equally balanced. To concentrate therefore means first to bring our minds into a condition of equilibrium which will enable us to consciously direct the flow of spirit to a definitely recognized purpose, and then carefully to guard our thoughts from inducing a flow in the opposite direction.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />Video edit &amp; Transcription: Spiritual Mind 7<br />Re-uploads are prohibited.<br /><br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏èInstagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Rsmeym">https://bit.ly/2Rsmeym</a><br />üß°Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2TMZlCm">https://bit.ly/2TMZlCm</a><br />üíõFacebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2HkwvaW">https://bit.ly/2HkwvaW</a><br />üíôAffiliate: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2RL7Xff">https://amzn.to/2RL7Xff</a>{% endraw %}
