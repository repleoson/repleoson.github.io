{% raw %}@Magnus Walker drives high voltage rock and roll! Today, we're in the canyons with the Petersen's Tesla-powered 1969 Porsche 912 and Magnus behind the wheel. Over the last year, the Petersen has worked with Omaze and Zelectric to build this Porsche to support the museum. Originally a stock 912, the Porsche was modified with a Tesla electric motor conversion , updated interior, exterior accessories, @HRE Wheels, @Michelin tires, suspension, brakes, and lighting, refreshing the look and tripling the power. <br /><br />The museum assembled this car to support its education programs and is currently on Omaze - Link here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.omaze.com/products/zelectric-porsche-912-ev.">https://www.omaze.com/products/zelectric-porsche-912-ev.</a><br /><br />RECOMMENDED PLAYLISTS<br /><br /><br />The Petersen Automotive Museum Vault: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/36G8tC0​​​">https://bit.ly/36G8tC0​​​</a><br /><br /><br />Ultimate Collection Tours | World's Rarest Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2VEAC6e​​​​">https://bit.ly/2VEAC6e​​​​</a><br /><br /><br />——<br />CONNECT WITH US ON SOCIAL MEDIA <br /><br /><br />Like us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PetersenMuse...">https://www.facebook.com/PetersenMuse...</a><br /><br /><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/petersenmus...">https://www.instagram.com/petersenmus...</a><br /><br /><br />Follow us on TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@petersen_muse...">https://www.tiktok.com/@petersen_muse...</a><br /><br /><br />——<br />LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PETERSEN AUTOMOTIVE MUSEUM<br /><br /><br />Click here to learn more about the Petersen Automotive Museum: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.petersen.org">https://www.petersen.org</a><br />Don’t miss any of our upcoming videos.
