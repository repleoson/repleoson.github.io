We knew that we had to host a Session this year, even if we couldn't physically have you there with us. And what better place to host it than in Iceland, with some of our closest friends: MEDUZA.<br /><br />This Session takes place in the deep south of Iceland, surrounded by hundreds of miles of black sand and mountains. We were hours from civilisation, exposed to the raw elements with nothing but each other and the breathtaking nature that surrounded us. We were isolated, cut-off and alone. The location for this Session plays homage to this year and the challenges it has presented us with and, most importantly, serves as a reminder to us all that wherever you are and however lost and lonely it may seem, hope can always be found.<br /><br />We’ve also teamed up with ZO-ON to offer you 15% off of all of their clothing:<br />ZO-ON: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/SelectedxZO-ON">https://bit.ly/SelectedxZO-ON</a><br /><br />Many thanks to our trip partners:<br />» Headline Partner: ZO-ON Clothing (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://zo-on.is/)">https://zo-on.is/)</a><br />» Beer52 (@beer52hq) (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/SelectedxBeer52)">https://bit.ly/SelectedxBeer52)</a><br />» Icelandair (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.icelandair.com/)">https://www.icelandair.com/)</a> <br />» Promote Iceland (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://visiticeland.com/)">https://visiticeland.com/)</a><br /><br />Production Credits:<br />» Executive Producer – Selected.
