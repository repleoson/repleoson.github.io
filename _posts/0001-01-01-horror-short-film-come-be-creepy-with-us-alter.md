It’s about emerging adulthood and millennial angst; about letting go of our pasts and embracing what it means to grow up.<br /><br />&quot;Come Be Creepy With Us&quot; by Beth Fletcher<br /><br />#ALTER #horror #shortfilm<br /><br />Connect with the Filmmakers: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ebmfletch/">https://www.instagram.com/ebmfletch/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ebmfletch">https://twitter.com/ebmfletch</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mlabbadee">https://www.instagram.com/mlabbadee</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/neeshcalneesh">https://www.instagram.com/neeshcalneesh</a><br /><br />More About &quot;Come Be Creepy With Us&quot;:  <br />Our film follows, Anna, a twenty-something living in Los Angeles. She used to be a complete badass who totally had her life together...but then her boyfriend left her and she got fired from her job. Her well-meaning but basic friends, Aaron and Carly, can’t give her the support she needs during this stagnant, insecure, and helpless time she’s stuck in...BUT THEN the undead corpse of a young woman comes up through her bathtub drain. This zombie-esque swamp monster turns out to be Bonnie, who was a young camper at Camp Dark Lake many years before. Bonnie drowned in the lake when Anna was a counselor in charge of watching the campers. Initially seeking revenge, Bonnie befriends Anna as they both find they are struggling with some of the same issues. They smoke a little weed, drink some champagne and make some friendship bracelets but eventually must learn to move on without each other.<br /><br />&quot;Come Be Creepy With Us&quot; Credits:<br />Directed by Beth Fletcher <br />Produced by Mike Labbadia <br />Written by Michael Calciano<br />Cinematography by Jesse Coyote<br />Production Designer Melissa Woods<br />Edited by Ede Bell-Crowder <br />Starring Adelaide Lummis, Jasmine Kimiko, Dylan Arnold, Tierra Luckey, Michael Calciano,  and Carissa Bazler<br />VFX by Chris Dold<br />Sound Design by Andrew Guastella<br /><br />About ALTER:<br />The most provocative minds in horror bring you three new short films every week exploring the human condition through warped and uncanny perspectives. <br /> <br />Be ready to leave the world you know behind and subscribe.
