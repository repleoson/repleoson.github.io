{% raw %}Angry KID Decided To CHALLENGE Me To In INSANE 1v1... (ROBLOX FUNKY FRIDAY) So we found an angry person trying to think he's wayy better then everyone else. This game is pretty similar to Friday Night Funkin. which is remade on roblox (lol). But we became on the last video and challenge as many people that we could to see who could beat us in a 1v1 challenge. We became Sky on a video, brightside, tord, and on last few videos we became Lemon Demon, and Zardy, And pico from fnf. We do try going against other top tier players!<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Rektway">https://twitter.com/Rektway</a><br />Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/groups/4656785/Rektway#!/about">https://www.roblox.com/groups/4656785/Rektway#!/about</a><br />Use Star Code Rektway when buying robux and premium: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux​​​​">https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux​​​​</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />What is ROBLOX? #Roblox​​​ is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­to­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms. #Roblox​​​ #Rektway​​​ #FunkyFriday{% endraw %}
