I believe that Games are the most effective medium from experiencing another world, and another way to live. Expect to see a series of videos showcasing the narratives hidden in every game, interviews with game developers, along with our bench mark weekly podcast, Dialogue Wheel. <br /><br />Andy Borkowski started this program nearly 10 years ago and, in that time, it has changed from a simple YouTube show, to a radio show, a TV show and now once again a YouTube destination.
