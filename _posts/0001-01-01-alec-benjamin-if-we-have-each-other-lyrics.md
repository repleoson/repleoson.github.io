way<br />On the East-side of the city, she was working every day<br />Cleaning dishes in the evening, she could barely stay awake<br />She was clinging to the feeling that her luck was gonna change<br />And, across town she'd take the bus at night to a one bedroom apartment<br />And then she'd turn on the light<br />She would sit down at the table<br />Tell herself that it's alright<br />She was waiting on the day that she hoped her baby would arrive<br />She'd never be alone<br />Have someone to hold<br />And when nights were cold, she'd say<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />The world's not perfect but it's not that bad<br />If we got each other and that's all we have<br />I will be your mother and I'll hold your hand<br />You should know I'll be there for you<br />And the world's not perfect<br />When the world's not kind<br />If we have each other then we'll both be fine<br />I will be your mother and I'll hold your hand<br />You should know I'll be there for you<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />They were 90 and were living out their days on the West-side of the city next to where they got engaged<br />They had pictures on the walls of all the memories that they made<br />And their life was never easy they were thankful that they stayed<br />With each other and though some times were hard<br />Even when she made him angry he would never break her heart<br />And they didn't have the money to afford a fancy car<br />But they never had to travel 'cause they'd never be apart<br />Even at the end, their love was stronger then the day that they first met<br />They'd say<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />The world's not perfect but it's not that bad<br />If we got each other and that's all we have<br />I will be your lover and I'll hold your hand<br />You should know I'll be there for you<br />And the world's not perfect<br />When the world's not kind<br />If we have each other then we'll both be fine<br />I will be your lover and I'll hold your hand<br />You should know I'll be there for you<br /><br />[Bridge]<br />You should know I'll be there for you<br /><br />[Verse 4]<br />I'm 23 and my folks are getting old<br />I know they don't have forever and I'm scared to be alone<br />So I'm thankful for my sister even though sometimes we fight<br />When high school wasn't easy, she's the reason I survived<br />I know she'd never leave me<br />And I hate to see her cry<br />So I wrote this verse to tell her that I'm always by her side<br />I wrote this verse to tell her that I'm always by her side<br />I wrote this verse to tell her that<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />The world's not perfect but it's not that bad<br />If we got each other and that's all we have<br />I will be your brother and I'll hold your hand<br />You should know I'll be there for you<br />And the world's not perfect<br />When the world's not kind<br />If we have each other then we'll both be fine<br />I will be your brother and I'll hold your hand<br />You should know I'll be there for you<br /><br />[Outro]<br />You should I know I'll be there for you<br /><br />#alecbenjamin<br />#ifwehhaveeachother<br />#aparadisebird<br /><br /><br />Comment #paradisebird if you see this😄 <br
