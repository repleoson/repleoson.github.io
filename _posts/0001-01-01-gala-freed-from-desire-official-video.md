(Italy SIAE), Mollyville Publishing S.r.l.<br /><br />Gala is a top dance music artist; she’s renowned for her minimal look and recognizable voice. Bearing the name of the muse of Salvador Dali and Paul Eluard, Gala left Italy when she was only 17 to attend a school of arts in Boston and  moved to New York in 1993, where she portrayed music and underground art community.<br />Gala sold over 6 million records all over the world. Her debut album Come Into My Life (dated 1997) includes multiplatinum singles: ”Freed from Desire” (#2 in UK and present for 8 weeks in a row in UK Top10 charts), Let A Boy Cry (#3 in Hot 100 european charts) and Come Into My Life (#1 in Italy, Spain and Brasil).<br />In 1996 Gala was elected Best Female Performer of the Year by Italian magazine Musica e Dischi. In July 1997 she has been awarded with the Italian Dance Award as best pop/dance artist of the year and was elected Best Foreign Artist of the year at Midem in Cannes, France. Gala has been awarded with golden and platinum records in France and Benelux and with a golden record in the UK. In the same year she gained a nomination as Best Dance Act at Mobo Awards in the UK together with Prodigy, Chemical Brothers e Orbital. Between 1995 and 1998 Gala attended several TV shows such as BBC’s Top Of The Pop in the UK, Taratata, Les Année Tubes and Hit Machine on Canal M6 in France, MTV Germany and performed live in famous arenas such as Bercy stadium in Paris and Las Ventanas in Madrid.<br />In 2014 Frida Gold project presented the song &quot;Liebe ist meine rebellion&quot;, German remake of Freed from desire, and went gold in Germany!<br />In 2016 Sean Kennedy, supporter of Wigan Athletic FC, decided to “customize” Freed From Desire and dedicate it to the amazing performances of Will Grigg in League One. It quickly became a real anthem, first for Wigan’s supporters and then for those of Northern Ireland, who never miss the chance to cheer for their idol.<br />To celebrate her &quot;first&quot; 20 years, Gala is back with a new acoustic version, fully played and sung again and included in the soundtrack of the recent movie by  Laurent Tirard titled &quot;Un homme à la hauteur&quot;, with Oscar-winning actor Jean Dujardin (The Artist).{% endraw %}
