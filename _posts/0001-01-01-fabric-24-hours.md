{% raw %}After summer 2021, we emerged from the pandemic with a revitalised energy, and whilst exciting changes have been made inside the club, we have also made changes to our programming ethos and are excited to return to extended events again...<br /><br />On Saturday 20th November, we'll launch ‘Continuum’ – a new series of 24+ hour parties for 2021-22, harking back to the foundations the venue was originally founded upon.
