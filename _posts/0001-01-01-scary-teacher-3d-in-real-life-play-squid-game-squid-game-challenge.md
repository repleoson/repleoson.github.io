{% raw %}Squid Game is a brilliant metaphor for several things, but especially capitalism. 456 broken and bankrupt rats are set on a deadly race for a vast prize in an absurd and cartoonish version of hell. And who would willingly leave hell if there was even a chance, however outlandish, that staying might suddenly make them a billionaire? Very little of this series otherwise makes sense, and it makes an absolute meal of it.<br /><br />There are similarities to shows like Battle Royale or Alice in Borderland, but Squid Game does a much better job of making characters believable and likeable. Even passing characters feel like actual people, so you care for the thirty seconds or so that you get to know them before they pass.<br /><br />The design of the show is brilliant, the performances are all excellent. The danger feels real and the jokes are genuinely funny. I'm only on episode 2, but I love this show already. Personally, I like it better than Alice in Borderland.<br /><br />EDIT: Just very quickly, a lot of reviews on here are mentioning the cringeworthy acting and dialogue of the VIPs. I agree, but I think there must be a reason for this. It seems unlikely that the same people who cast, wrote and directed all the other terrific performances suddenly lost the ability to cast, write for and direct non-Koreans. It seems more likely their relative cartoonishness had a specific meaning and purpose... even if we haven't figured out what it is, yet.<br /><br /><br />Welcome to the channel DG2T COLOR - SCARY TEACHER YesPapa<br />This is a video based on the inspiration and plot of the game: SCARY TEACHER 3D, and other Famous Characters!<br />We build video content around entertaining, funny situations, life lessons, valuable stories!<br /><br />#ScaryTeacherYesPaPa<br />#ScaryTeacherVideo<br />#dg2tvideo<br />© Copyright DG2T COLOR ☞ Do not Reup <br />© Copyright all rights reserved{% endraw %}
