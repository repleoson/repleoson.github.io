{% raw %}Covid quarantine and my departure from my normal life, I admit, have been tough on me. But I remain grateful for all the things that I am still able to do. Tonight I thought of sharing with you some of the things I learned during quarantine and I’m hoping to hear yours, too. ❤️<br /><br />Special moments call for special coffee! Check out NESCAFÉ GOLD - made with Arabica beans, golden roasted to perfection for the moments that matter. <br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nescafe.com/ph/our-coffees/gold">https://www.nescafe.com/ph/our-coffees/gold</a><br />Your Home Café: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nescafe.com/ph/your-home-cafe">https://www.nescafe.com/ph/your-home-cafe</a><br />NESCAFÉ Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Nescaf%C3%A9-GOLD-Philippines-103815014903807/">https://www.facebook.com/Nescaf%C3%A9-GOLD-Philippines-103815014903807/</a><br /><br />LOVE MARIE ONGPAUCO-ESCUDERO (known in the Philippine entertainment industry as Heart Evangelista) started her career at the age of 13 as a commercial model and actress.
