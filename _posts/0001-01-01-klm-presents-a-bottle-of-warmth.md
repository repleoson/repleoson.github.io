{% raw %}This winter, we made a special surprise exclusively for Chinese passengers. They were given exclusive heating bottles at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. This warm bottle campaign takes full consideration of Chinese people’s drinking habits. With these heating bottles they are not only able to enjoy hot water when they arrive in Amsterdam, but can also easily and conveniently drink hot water during their entire journey.<br />Wherever you are traveling, there is always a cup of warmth on the go.<br /><br /><br />Get in touch with us:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.klm.com">https://www.klm.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/klm">https://www.facebook.com/klm</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/klm">https://www.twitter.com/klm</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/klm">https://www.instagram.com/klm</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/klm">https://www.linkedin.com/company/klm</a><br /><br />This is KLM's official YouTube channel where we share an insight into our world.
