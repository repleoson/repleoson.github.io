You can see their eyes light up and their interest is visibly raised when presented with these strong images. Add to that the extra dimensions of movement and sound, and your baby will be suitably impressed!<br /><br />Music List<br /><br />Blue Danube - Strauss<br />Clouds - Huma-Huma<br />Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairies - Tchaikovsky<br />Fur Elise - Beethoven<br />Moonlight Sonata - Beethoven<br />Morning Mood - Greig<br />The Rain - Silent Partner<br />Waltz Of The Flowers - Tchaikovsky<br /><br />Most is available from the YouTube Audio Library!...<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/...">https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/...</a>{% endraw %}
