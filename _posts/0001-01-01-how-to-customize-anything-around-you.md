In this video, I show you how decorate and come up with your own useful tools and designs. <br /><br />Take some canvas fabric and lay it on the floor. Then, fill a small bucket with paint, step in it with one foot and then dance around on the paper to give it a very unique print-look. <br /><br />You can give some color to your phone case using nail polish. Take various nail polish colors and pour them on your phone case. Then, using a hair drier let them dry and voila. <br /><br />You can also use spray paint on a clear phone case to give your phone a galaxy look.
