{% raw %}Welcome to Hey Bear Sensory! <br /><br />This video is not a traditional counting tool, and you won't see any numbers. But we encourage you to use the the scenes within to encourage and introduce counting, for example, there's five blueberries and they all jump five times. Maybe get some blueberries out of the fridge and count with them as well ( and eat them!). The thought process behind this was that most 'learning' or counting tools are focused on remembering the numerical symbol, for example seeing numbers lined up 1-10. You can count the movements, the characters or both. Theres plenty of opportunity to learn, or just enjoy your favourite characters! <br />All of our ￼animations are presented to you in beautiful 4K at 60 frames per second. They feature individually designed characters set to music the whole family will enjoy!<br />Explore our library of content and discover a range of videos that promote happiness, movement, learning, visual tracking, sleep, relaxation and more. We are committed to developing enriching, engaging, inclusive and diverse content that you will love. Your feedback and experiences are important to us, and helps us to improve our future videos. We encourage parents and carers to give us feedback via our HeyBear Sensory YouTube community and Instagram and Facebook pages.<br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />VISIT              HEYBEARSENSORY.COM<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.heybearsensory.com">https://www.heybearsensory.com</a><br /><br />CONNECT     COMMUNITY PAGE<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Slowboy71/community">https://www.youtube.com/user/Slowboy71/community</a><br /><br />JOIN               MAILING LIST<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mailchi.mp/d2d2a0759f7a/heybearnews">https://mailchi.mp/d2d2a0759f7a/heybearnews</a><br /><br />SUPPORT      PATREON<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/HeyBearProductions">https://www.patreon.com/HeyBearProductions</a><br /><br />FOLLOW        INSTAGRAM<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/heybearsensory/">https://www.instagram.com/heybearsensory/</a><br /><br />DOWNLOAD  WAYOKIDS<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wayokids.com/hey-bear-sensory">https://wayokids.com/hey-bear-sensory</a><br /><br /><br />Most is available from the YouTube Audio Library!...<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/...">https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/...</a><br /><br /><br />Track List<br /><br />Come On In - Silent Partner<br />Cumbia No Frills Faster - Kevin MacLeod<br />Groovy Baby - Audionautix<br />Misty - Slynk<br />Goat - Wayne Jones<br />Pull Up Riddim - Konrad OldMoney<br />Good Times - Patrick Patrikios<br />Cafe Con Leche - Silent Partner<br />Timeless - Slenderbeats<br /><br />Cumbia No Frills Faster by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution licence (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)</a><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-...">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-...</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a><br /><br />Groovy Baby by Audionautix is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution licence (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://audionautix.com/">http://audionautix.com/</a>{% endraw %}
