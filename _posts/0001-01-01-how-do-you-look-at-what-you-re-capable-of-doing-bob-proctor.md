{% raw %}Bob Proctor explains ONE thing to change virtually everything in your life - <br />Your paradigm has an enormous influence on your perception. Your perception is how you see things. That controls your point of view, it's your perception. <br />If you’re not as happy, healthy and wealthy as you’d like to be, I urge you to step back and look at your situation from a different perspective.<br /><br />But don’t just look at it in a general or superficial way; go further than you ever have before. Look beyond the reasons you’ve come up with for why you can’t change or get what you want until you “see” a way to improve your current circumstances.<br />It's your perception, it controls how you look at it. If I have a particular challenge I'm having difficulty with, I will take and write it out as I see it. As I see it. At that time. And I will put it on a piece of paper as clear as possible in as few words as possible. And I'll put it in the center of the table. Then I'll sit down and I'll look at it, and I keep repeating, &quot;is that in me, or is it on the table? Is the problem in me, or is it on the paper? Is it in me, or -&quot; And I'll keep doing that until I get it out of me and get it on the paper.<br /><br />What am I doing? I am enabling myself to look at it objectively. If you stay subjective with something, you're gonna get all messed up. And I get it on the paper. Then I'll go and sit on the other side of the table, and I'll mentally get into Earl Nightingale's energy and I said, &quot;how would Earl look at this?&quot; And I'll play with that for a while. Then I'll go sit somewhere else and I'll say, &quot;how would Earl Nightingale, or how would Napoleon Hill look at this?&quot; And I would take different people I've studied. &quot;How would Thomas Troward view this?&quot; I would stay in the chair long enough, mentally get in their energy, you can get in another person's energy very easily. You just think of them and you're in their energy.<br /><br />What I'm doing, I'm playing with my own mind to shift my perception of the situation and pretty soon, what was the problem has disappeared. And I may have turned it into an enormous opportunity. <br /><br />Bob Proctor Coaching: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2qkLZ2Y">https://bit.ly/2qkLZ2Y</a><br />**For more visit our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/kYTfZp">http://goo.gl/kYTfZp</a> **<br />Subscribe for more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/VL0Smo">http://goo.gl/VL0Smo</a><br /><br />Check out our most popular video series!<br />1.
