I feel that by doing it, we not only faced some of our biggest fears, but it enabled us to use our talents to bring some light to people that need it. As we move forward to the Hollywood Bowl show and beyond, I think about the people that connect with the band, outside and inside our circle. This video is a gesture of good will to the people that want that connection.&quot;<br />- JOE HAHN<br /><br />&quot;One More Light was written with the intention of sending love to those who lost someone. We now find ourselves on the receiving end. In memorial events, art, videos, and images, fans all over the world have gravitated towards this song as their declaration of love and support for the band and the memory of our dear friend, Chester. We are so very grateful and can‚Äôt wait to see you again.&quot;  <br />- MIKE SHINODA<br /><br />Directed by Joe Hahn &amp; Mark Fiore.<br /><br />Apple Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://lprk.co/apple">http://lprk.co/apple</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://lprk.co/spotify">http://lprk.co/spotify</a><br />Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://lprk.co/amazon">http://lprk.co/amazon</a><br /><br />Follow Linkin Park:<br />Web: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkinpark.com/">https://www.linkinpark.com/</a><br />Official Community: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://LPUnderground.com">https://LPUnderground.com</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://lprk.co/facebook">http://lprk.co/facebook</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://lprk.co/instagram">http://lprk.co/instagram</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://lprk.co/twitter">http://lprk.co/twitter</a><br />MFR: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://musicforrelief.org">https://musicforrelief.org</a><br /><br />Linkin Park is an alternative rock band renowned for their hits ‚ÄúNumb,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the End,‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôve Done,‚Äù ‚ÄúCastle of Glass,‚Äù ‚ÄúNew Divide,‚Äù ‚ÄúCrawling,‚Äù and ‚ÄúFaint.‚Äù  They worked with artists like Jay-Z, Metallica, Steve Aoki, and Paul McCartney ‚Äî amassing billions of global streams and received the UN Global Leadership Award for their humanitarian work.<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored?<br />Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore?<br />We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep<br />There are things that we can have, but can't keep<br /><br />If they say<br />Who cares if one more light goes out?<br />In the sky of a million stars<br />It flickers, flickers<br />Who cares when someone's time runs out?<br />If a moment is all we are<br />Or quicker, quicker<br />Who cares if one more light goes out?<br />Well I do<br /><br />The reminders, pull the floor from your feet<br />In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh<br />And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair<br />Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there<br /><br />If they say<br />Who cares if one more light goes out?<br />In the sky of a million stars<br />It flickers, flickers<br />Who cares when someone's time runs out?<br />If a moment is all we are<br />Or quicker, quicker<br />Who cares if one more light goes out?<br />Well I do<br /><br />(I do)<br /><br />Who cares if one more light goes out?<br />In the sky of a million stars<br />It flickers, flickers<br />Who cares when someone's time runs out?<br />If a moment is all we are<br />Or quicker, quicker<br />Who cares if one more light goes out?<br />Well I do<br />Well I do <br /><br />#OfficialMusicVideo #LinkinPark #OneMoreLight #WeAreWarnerRecords{% endraw %}
