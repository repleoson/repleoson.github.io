{% raw %}Join David in a fascinating discussion of the 11-year sunspot cycle, where the sun’s activity alternates between a boiling inferno and a placid pond. <br /><br /><br />A Russian scientist was sentenced to decades in a concentration camp after discovering how this solar activity has been precisely affecting mass human consciousness… for centuries.<br /><br /><br />Discover the four-part “theme” that occurs in each solar cycle, as discovered by subsequent researchers, and where we are now. <br /><br /><br />This is not to be missed. <br /><br /><br />The next few years are going to be very intense. <br /><br /><br />Once you see David present the science, it will become clear that we will probably continue to see a rise in the novelty and intensity of events on Earth.<br /><br /><br />However, the solar cycle science also reveals that these changes lead to very positive transformations. <br /><br /><br />We may well be at the “Global Dark Night of the Soul” right now, before these energies propel us into a much more vigorous and prosperous future.<br /><br />Visit The Disclosure Course Experience to learn more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thedisclosure.com/course/">https://thedisclosure.com/course/</a>{% endraw %}
