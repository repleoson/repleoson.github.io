{% raw %}The F-15EX is a ready-now replacement for the F-15C that includes best-in-class payload, range and speed. Designed to deliver value to the U.S. Air Force, the F-15EX will be a backbone fighter for the service â€“ not just today, but for the next several decades. Boeing engineers created hundreds of digital aircraft before cutting any metal, and flew thousands of hours before our first test flight. The result is an aircraft with a digital backbone, open system architecture and the capacity to carry hypersonic weapons, making it a key element of the U.S. Air Forceâ€™s tactical fighter fleet.<br /><br />This page provides the information you need for F-15EX. We invite you to sign up to receive the latest updates from Boeing, and learn about how weâ€™ve already begun fulfilling our commitments to deliver this critical fighter to the U.S. Air Force.<br /><br />Other videos you might like:<br />This is America's E-6 Mercury â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ZZRH-k4TUuQ">https://youtu.be/ZZRH-k4TUuQ</a><br />Why America's Enemies Feared the P-47 â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/bYssexVvggA">https://youtu.be/bYssexVvggA</a><br />America's Crazy Flying Aircraft Carrier  â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/EgbgIOThb4E">https://youtu.be/EgbgIOThb4E</a><br /><br />ðŸ”” SUBSCRIBE TO US â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/USMilitaryNewsUSM?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/c/USMilitaryNewsUSM?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Thank You{% endraw %}
