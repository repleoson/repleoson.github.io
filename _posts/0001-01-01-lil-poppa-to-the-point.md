saying tho<br />Why the fuck a nigga acting like<br />This fame shit done got to a nigga or sumthin<br />Like a nigga asked for this shit<br />Like a nigga won’t give all this shit up<br />And head back to Desi block<br />You know twelve-double-o shit<br />Never on no hoe shit, always on some go sit<br />Come on tell me some more shit<br />Tell me some shit ion know<br /><br />Verse 1:<br />Why ion respond to none of that shit<br />Cuz I ain’t no social thug<br />And no that shit don’t come with a diss boy that shit come with slugs<br />I let the media do they job, they supposed to judge<br />Been losing love from mafuccas I’m supposed to love<br />And I don’t know no other way so I’ma cope with drugs<br />One gotta stay cuz ain’t no room for the both of us<br />One tried to play but ain’t make it, he got his head bust<br />Pressure come behind me what you think that nigga dead fo’<br />And I been seeing dead folks but I ain’t scared <br />That ain’t what the fuck these meds fo’<br />Eyes red Corbin who these tears shed for<br />Them memories I play it too busy telling a story I ain’t got time to diss the dead<br />But fuck them niggas they dead how many times I gotta say it<br />Don’t speak on Desi let him rest bitch nigga better wear a vest<br />Play *** and make em’ wear a dress<br />Too real for interviews and press<br />Keep it cool I ain’t stressing<br />Cuz we turn L’s into lessons<br />And all them L’s turned to blessings<br />I’m that nigga in that gold Mercury with that chrome Smith and Wesson<br />Thought ya had me but ya wrong, bitch that’s what you get for guessing<br />Real playa, got her leaking through the phone and we just texting<br />How you turn a bitch on through a message<br /><br />Chorus:<br />She say keep talking that shit I like it<br />And don’t compare me to these niggas they ain’t nothing like me<br />I done seen it all, ain’t too much of this shit can excite me<br />I made it out it made you sick nigga<br />I hear ya diss, get off my dick (die on the 6)<br />She said you finna put all that weed in that blunt<br />Bitch you know I roll thonks get to the point<br />Had to tell that hoe it ain’t no seeds bitch this runtz<br />Had to cut em off they only call me for they needs and they wants<br /><br />Verse 2:<br />If you really love me why you don’t show it then, that be that fake shit<br />Say youngin better slow down before ya crash, get ya brakes fixed<br />And a nigga ain’t around if he ain’t down to let that K spit<br />So just tell me what’s the word I get ya served on some lil saint shit<br />Windows tented in these foreign cars I watch rain hit<br />Collect calls from my dawgs, won’t change at all I’m the same jit <br />And they still on that gang shit, detectives think we bang but we don’t bang<br />That’s why we be the ones to blame when some brains split<br />Just cover the ones got caught and pray for the ones that we ain’t get<br />Lately I ain’t been thinking my mind been on some blank shit<br />Tryna break the bank shit<br />Bitch I’m wildchild you know it’s Evergreen for life nigga I can’t switch<br />And I just left the hood they all proud of this fame shit<br />But they don’t know the pain that it came with<br />Shit worse than being in front of the house that day when the tank hit<br />And these niggas around me gone take hits while I’ma sit back and make hits<br /><br />Chorus:<br />She say keep talking that shit I like it<br />And don’t compare me to these niggas they ain’t nothing like me<br />I done seen it all, ain’t too much of this shit can excite me<br />I made it out it made you sick nigga<br />I hear ya diss get off my dick (die on the 6)<br />She said you finna put all that weed in that blunt<br />Bitch you know I roll thonks get to the point<br />Had to tell that hoe it ain’t no seeds bitch this runtz<br />Had to cut em off they only call me for they needs and they wants<br /><br />She say keep talking that shit I like<br />And don’t compare me to these niggas they ain’t nothing like me<br />I done seen it all, ain’t too much that can excite me<br />I made it out it made you sick<br />I hear you diss, get off my dick<br />She said you finna put all that weed in that blunt<br />Bitch you know I roll thonks get to the point<br />I told that hoe it ain’t no seeds but this runtz<br />Had to cut him off they only call me for they needs and they wants<br /><br />#LilPoppa #ToThePoint<br /><br />Music video by Lil Poppa performing To The Point. © 2020 Rule #1/Interscope Records{% endraw %}
