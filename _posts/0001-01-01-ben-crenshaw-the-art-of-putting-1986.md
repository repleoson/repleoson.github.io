{% raw %}Ben Crenshaw - The Art of Putting - 1986<br />Ben Crenshaw was one of the best putters ever. When this video was made, he had won the Masters in 1984. In part due to his great touch on the challenging greens. Later, he won the Masters again in 1995.<br />Ben is more of a &quot;feel&quot; putter who stands tall to the ball, and putts on the arc. He is more of a body putter than most. Also, stands open to the line.<br />This video covers a lot of good material. Including footage of other great putters including Bobby Jones. <br />Chapters are below:<br />0:00 Introduction<br />1:45 (1) My Philosophy of Putting<br />3:25 (2) My 3 Principles of Good Putting<br />5:30 (3) The Paramount Importance of Feel<br />7:12 (4) The Grip<br />8:48 (5) The Stance<br />10:57 (6) The Stroke<br />13:24 (7) Analyzing the Masters<br />14:20 (8) Long Putts<br />15:50 (9) Short Putts<br />17:38 (10) Analyzing the Masters<br />20:28 (11) Reading the Greens<br />23:38 (12) Warming Up<br />25:00 (13) Practice Drills/Games<br />28:24 (14) The Teaching of Bobby Jones - Vintage Footage<br />36:52 (15) Review{% endraw %}
