For example, after elicitations and concept checking questions (CCQs).<br /><br />Summary of English Grammar: Future Simple Tense – Will / Won’t<br />Approximate chronological order:<br /><br />Functions and Uses:<br />– Promises: I will love you forever.<br />– Offers: I‘ll help you eat it!<br />– Spontaneous or quick decisions: I‘ll get help…<br />– Spontaneous threats: I‘ll make you sorry!<br />– Predictions about the future: In the future… you will die!<br /><br />Form:<br />Positive: will<br />Contractions: I’ll, you’ll, we’ll…<br />Negative: will not<br />Contraction: won’t<br />– Use contractions when speaking.<br /><br />Summary of Functions and Uses<br /><br />Other Important Information: &quot;will&quot; and &quot;won’t&quot; vs. &quot;be going to&quot;<br /><br />The simple future tense comes in two variations:<br />- &quot;Will&quot; and &quot;won’t&quot;<br />- &quot;be going to&quot;<br />These two variations can have different meanings and cannot always be used interchangeably. be going to is used for talking about future plans and also for making predictions. While will and won’t can also be used to make predictions, we do not use them to talk about future plans. Hence, only in the case of making predictions, may we use will and won’t and be going to interchangeably. Take for example:<br />Speaker A: Can you wash the car today?<br />Speaker B: I’ll do it tomorrow.<br />Speaker B did not plan on washing the car tomorrow. Rather, it was a spontaneous decision caused by speaker A’s request. Had speaker B said I’m going to do it tomorrow, it would suggest that speaker B already planned on washing the car tomorrow prior to speaker A asking.<br />This video only focuses on will and won’t. We will explore be going to in other videos.{% endraw %}
