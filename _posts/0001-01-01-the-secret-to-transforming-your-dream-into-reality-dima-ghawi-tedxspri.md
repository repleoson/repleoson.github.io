{% raw %}In this TEDx, Dima transports the audience decades back to her grandmotherâ€™s kitchen in the Middle East where she received a gift that fueled her lifelong determination. Through personal narratives, Dima shares the power of transforming a dream into a belief by first making it tangible, and then harnessing the desire and determination to take action to make it a reality. <br /><br />Dima draws from two decades of corporate experience leading global teams and developing future leaders worldwide. Through keynote speeches, workshops and executive coaching, Dima shares her unique leadership journey with one goal in mind: motivate and activate those around her to re-imagine their potential and grow into leaders.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
