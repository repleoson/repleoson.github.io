{% raw %}Legendary musical group performs &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot; at Global Citizen Live.<br /><br />Global Citizen Live calls for action to halt climate change and for wealthy countries to deliver on the $100B climate pledge, $6B for famine relief, and COVID-19 vaccine justice for all. On Sept. 25, 2021, over 60M COVID-19 vaccines, 157M trees, and more than US$1.1B in commitments to climate, famine, and COVID-19 response efforts were announced as part of the partner-led campaign. The Global Citizen Live campaign continues in the lead-up to the G20 Summit and the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) later this year.<br />_____________________________________________________________________<br />Global Citizen is a social action platform for a global generation that aims to solve the worldâ€™s biggest challenges.
