{% raw %}train that stubborn lower part of your belly ♥︎  / Werbung <br /><br />One of the most requested videos ever! <br />I never wanted to do it because most people advertise their videos like &quot;LOSE LOWER BELLY FAT&quot;. But we (hopefully) all know: you won't burn only fat in this specific place by training it. <br /><br />STILL: having strong lower abs is very beneficial. It keeps your core tight, prevents back pain, makes your belly look flatter because you can &quot;hold it in&quot; better and: if you lose that fat, you will also see your Ab Lines! <br /><br />Please, please, please make sure: <br />▸ to keep your LOWER BACK FLAT ON THE MAT. This is essential for your health &amp; essential for training your lower abs. If you don't keep it flat on the mat, you will not train your lower abs. Only move your legs downwards as far as possible (for example during a leg lift). If that means you only have a small range of motion: FINE. You will improve over time.  <br />▸ you can lay your head on the mat, if that's more comfortable. This makes it ever harder for the lower abs! I tend to lift my head after some minutes, because I otherwise feel my lower back lifting off the mat. <br />▸ it's about the mind muscle connection! Think about your abs &amp; lift and lower your legs with the strength of your abs, not your thighs. <br /><br />Hope you enjoy this routine! It's short, hard &amp; effective ♥︎<br /><br />__<br /><br />No Equipment necessary, no breaks (you're used to it by now I guess) and not much space needed :) If you need a break tho - take it! Just don't quit! <br /><br />The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing 30s for each exercise. <br />__<br />▸  my Pam App ♥︎ Free workout plans, recipes &amp; tips: <br />Apple: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/app/pam/id1540604002">https://apps.apple.com/app/pam/id1540604002</a><br />Android: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openreply.pam">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openreply.pam</a><br /><br />▸ you can find FREE WORKOUT PLANS on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations.
