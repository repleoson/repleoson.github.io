{% raw %}In 2004 you could buy this unique nostalgic novelty reel-to-reel, CD player combo. But is it just a novelty if it really works?<br /><br />00:00 Start<br />01:40 Here it is<br />04:59 Unboxing with a story<br />06:01 First look<br />07:06 Power on tests<br />08:57 Getting the tape on<br />12:46 Tape Tests<br />17:50 Undercover secrets<br />20:29 Inside the back<br />22:36 A cassette experiment<br />23:54 Audio demo<br />24:53 Summing up<br />27:55 Patreon credits<br /><br />FAQ<br />Q) When you played the audio from the cassette was the wow and flutter due to a lack of back tension on the tape/friction against the tape shell/insert other thing here?<br />A) Yes - This was only a basic demonstration to prove the tape in this machine has the same track configuration and plays at the same speed as a typical cassette tape. But of course it would do, after all it is just a cassette mech. Don't get hung up on how crappy this cassette demo sounds - it was just an experiment to prove specs - not sound quality. If you want to hear a demo of the sound quality...keep watching as there's a full section with a comparison against a CD. <br /><br />Q) Did you put the cover screws in wrong - I noticed one was sticking though to the back?<br />A) Yep - I swapped them across later.<br /><br />CORRECTION<br />I transposed two digits. The speakers are 8ohm 5W.<br /><br />--------------- SUBSCRIBE ------------------<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Techmoan?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/user/Techmoan?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />------------- Merchandise -----------------<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/techmoan-merch">https://teespring.com/stores/techmoan-merch</a><br /><br />------------- SUPPORT ---------------<br />This channel can be supported through Patreon <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/techmoan">https://www.patreon.com/techmoan</a><br />  <br />*******Patrons usually have early access to videos*******<br /><br />---------- Outro Music -----------<br />Over Time - Vibe Tracks <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/VSSswVZSgJw">https://youtu.be/VSSswVZSgJw</a>{% endraw %}
