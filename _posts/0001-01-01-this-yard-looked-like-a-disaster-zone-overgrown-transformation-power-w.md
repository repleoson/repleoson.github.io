{% raw %}The family that lives here needed some major help, so we got stuck in and solved the problem. All up, we took out about 4 trailer loads of rubbish and gave the entire place a good cleanup, trimmed some bushes, and power washed the drive &amp; paths. The job took us around 12 hours to complete and we also organised the gutters to be cleared by a third party, so they got the works.
