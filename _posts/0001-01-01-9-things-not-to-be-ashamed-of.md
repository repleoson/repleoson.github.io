{% raw %}Is there anything you're ashamed of? Shame is a common emotion that I’m sure all of us have felt before. But carrying shame deep down can affect you in many harmful ways and often holds you back from your true potential. Yet, more often than not, we end up carrying shame that isn’t ours to carry.
