{% raw %}When something ceases in your life, thatâ€™s a sign that something better is on the way. God never stops provision unless he has something better in store. Don't be discouraged when a door closes. God is about to take you where you could not go on your own!<br /><br />Follow #JoelOsteen on social<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://Bit.ly/JoelOTW">http://Bit.ly/JoelOTW</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://BIt.lu/JoelIG">http://BIt.lu/JoelIG</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://Bit.ly/JoelOFB">http://Bit.ly/JoelOFB</a><br /><br />ðŸ›ŽSubscribe to receive weekly messages of hope, encouragement, and inspiration from Joel! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/JoelYTSub">http://bit.ly/JoelYTSub</a>{% endraw %}
