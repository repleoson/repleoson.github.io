{% raw %}14 big planes, beautiful autumn weather and great special liveries. Is there anything else you need for a perfect planespotting day? The special &quot;Wildlife&quot; Airbus A380 of Emirates is the most interesting Airbus A380 special livery which is currently cruising through the skies and yesterday it arrived at DÃ¼sseldorf during perfect weather conditions. L ast saturday I also filmed the special Star Wars livery of All Nippon Airways which arrived from Tokyo. <br /><br />Condor just started new long haul flights to the caribean and the new livery just looks stunning on the Boeing 767. It` s a pleasure to see these long haul birds on a daily basis at DUS from now on. <br /><br />Thanks for watching, new videos every tuesday and friday.{% endraw %}
