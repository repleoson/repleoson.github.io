{% raw %}The Astronomia Sky is a £538,000 watch made by luxury watch brand Jacob &amp; Co.<br /><br />With only 18 being produced worldwide and costing more than half a million pounds, it's a very rare and expensive watch - so what makes it so special?<br /><br />Jacob and Co watchmaker, Luca Soprana says: &quot;The Astronomia is a very, very delicate piece. Every component needs to be perfectly balanced so we need to use very special materials - like titanium - that are very delicate. The idea is really to come with a watch that is three dimensional and the watch has to be spectacular.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;What really makes the piece special is really the technique. The complexity of how it works, and to have an equilibrium of all the components.&quot;<br /><br />The face of the watch has a small star map, replicating the rotation of the celestial stars. It's an impressive looking watch, but at £538,000 it's ridiculously expensive. Would you buy one?<br /><br />----------------------------------------­­­­----------<br /><br />Follow BI UK on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1Nz3jG3">http://bit.ly/1Nz3jG3</a><br />Follow BI UK on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1VWDkiy">http://bit.ly/1VWDkiy</a><br />Follow BI UK on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2gsLEds">http://bit.ly/2gsLEds</a><br />Read more on BI UK: uk.businessinsider.com<br /><br />----------------------------------------­­­­----------<br /><br />Business Insider UK is the largest business news site for British readers and viewers in the UK.
