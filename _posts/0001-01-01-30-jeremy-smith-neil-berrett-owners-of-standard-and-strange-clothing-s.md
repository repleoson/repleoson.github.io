{% raw %}Today I sit down with Jeremy Smith and Neil Berrett owners of Standard and Strange which I would say is one of the greatest clothing shops I've ever been in. <br /><br />These 2 took their passion for High End Quality Clothing and made a business out of it.<br />I could talk to these guys all day long about Leather Jackets, Japanese Denim, Hand Made Boots and all things Fashion.<br /><br />Jeremy and Neil started from the ground up in a small 200 square foot shop in Oakland to now having 2 very successful shops including one in Santa Fe New Mexico.<br /><br />Their Knowledge is next level on Japanese Hand Made clothing especially The Real McCoy's brand which happens to be my all time favorite brand.<br /><br />Tune in and enjoy their story and make sure you visit their shops and instagram page <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/standardandstrange/">https://www.instagram.com/standardandstrange/</a>{% endraw %}
