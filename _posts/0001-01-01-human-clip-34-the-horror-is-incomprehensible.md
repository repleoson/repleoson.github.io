{% raw %}&quot;An excerpt from HUMAN, the new film by Yann Arthus-Bertrand.<br /><br />What is it that makes us human? Is it that we love, that we fight? That we laugh? Cry? Our curiosity? <br />Driven by these questions, filmmaker and artist Yann Arthus-Bertrand spent three years collecting real-life stories from 2,000 women and men in 60 countries. Working with a dedicated team of translators, journalists and cameramen, Yann captures deeply personal and emotional accounts of topics that unite us all; struggles with poverty, war, homophobia, and the future of our planet mixed with moments of love and happiness.  <br /><br />In order to share this unique image bank everywhere and for everyone,<br />HUMAN  exist in several version : <br />A theatre version (3h11) ,  a tv version (2h11) and a 3 volumes version for the web<br /><br />CONTACTS<br />Office Yann Arthus-Bertrand : Yann2@yab.fr<br />Project manager: jessica@human-themovie.org<br />Head of international screenings and distribution : lara@human-themovie.org<br />French events and non-commercial distribution : event@human-themovie.org<br /><br />Official website HUMAN : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.human-themovie.org">http://www.human-themovie.org</a> <br />For further contents, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://g.co/humanthemovie">http://g.co/humanthemovie</a><br />Enjoy and share #WhatMakesUsHUMAN<br />Watch the full film from September 12 at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJy4nUo1D4R3hlcP8XCLX9Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJy4nUo1D4R3hlcP8XCLX9Q</a><br /><br />All these shoots were carbon-offset through the GoodPlanet Foundationâ€™s United Carbone Action program: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.goodplanet.org/en/united-carbon-action/">http://www.goodplanet.org/en/united-carbon-action/</a>{% endraw %}
