{% raw %}Heartburn a symptom of Acid reflux. This video is about treatment, causes, diet &amp; foods to avoid to naturally stop acid reflux.<br /><br />Heartburn is a burning feeling in the chest caused by stomach acid travelling up towards the throat (acid reflux). If it keeps happening, it’s called gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).<br /><br />Acid reflux is very common in fact 1 in 10 people get acid reflux almost every day! In this weeks video I’m going to give you some great tips that should really help.<br /><br />This video was sponsored by Dr Fox (Online Doctor &amp; Pharmacy):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.doctorfox.co.uk">https://www.doctorfox.co.uk</a><br /><br />MAIN SYMPTOMS OF ACID REFLUX:<br />• Heartburn – a burning sensation in the middle of your chest<br />an unpleasant sour taste in your mouth, caused by stomach acid<br />You may also have:<br />• Cough or hiccups that keep coming back<br />• Hoarse voice<br />• Bad breath<br />• Wind, Bloating and feeling sick<br />• Your symptoms will probably be worse after eating, when lying down and when bending over.<br /><br />TIPS THAT HELP WITH ACID REFLUX:<br />• Eat smaller, more frequent meals<br />• Raise one end of your bed 10 to 20cm by putting something under your bed or mattress – make it so your chest and head are above the level of your waist, so stomach acid doesn't travel up towards your throat<br />• Try to lose weight if you're overweight<br />• Try to find ways to relax<br />• If you are a smoker stop smoking<br />• Some foods and drinks may make reflux worse in some people, here is a link to a great acid reflux diet sheet which I mentioned in the video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patient.info/health/acid-reflux-and-oesophagitis/features/diet-sheet-for-oesophageal-reflux">https://patient.info/health/acid-reflux-and-oesophagitis/features/diet-sheet-for-oesophageal-reflux</a><br />• Some medicines may make symptoms worse. They may irritate the oesophagus or relax the sphincter muscle and make acid reflux more likely. Tell your pharmacist if you suspect that a medicine is causing the symptoms, or making symptoms worse.<br />• Posture. Lying down or bending forward a lot during the day encourages reflux. Sitting hunched or wearing tight belts may put extra pressure on the stomach, which may make any reflux worse.<br />• Bedtime. If symptoms recur most nights, the following may help:<br />Go to bed with an empty, dry stomach. To do this, don't eat in the last three hours before bedtime and don't drink in the last two hours before bedtime.<br /><br />If lifestyle changes and pharmacy medicines aren't helping then please see your GP.<br /><br />RED FLAGS:<br />Any of the following red flags should prompt you to urgently see a GP:<br />• Have heartburn most days for 3 weeks or more<br />• Have other symptoms, like food getting stuck in your throat or difficulty swallowing<br />• Are frequently being sick<br />• Have unexplained weight loss<br />• Have black or tarry stools<br />• Have a gnawing, sharp or stabbing pain.<br />• Feel like you have a lump in your stomach<br />• Have bloody vomit or poo<br /><br />I have tried my best to add as many red flag symptoms but incase I have missed anything please make sure to visit the following pages as well,<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heartburn-and-acid-reflux/">https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heartburn-and-acid-reflux/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/indigestion/">https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/indigestion/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patient.info/health/acid-reflux-and-oesophagitis">https://patient.info/health/acid-reflux-and-oesophagitis</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patient.info/health/acid-reflux-and-oesophagitis/features/diet-sheet-for-oesophageal-reflux">https://patient.info/health/acid-reflux-and-oesophagitis/features/diet-sheet-for-oesophageal-reflux</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patient.info/doctor/gastro-oesophageal-reflux-disease">https://patient.info/doctor/gastro-oesophageal-reflux-disease</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.chemistanddruggist.co.uk/feature/ask-expert-indigestion-and-heartburn">https://www.chemistanddruggist.co.uk/feature/ask-expert-indigestion-and-heartburn</a><br /><br /><br />Want to see more videos about everything health and pharmacy?
