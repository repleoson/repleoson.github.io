{% raw %}Sky News Business Editor Ross Greenwood says a person should be able to nominate whichever COVID-19 jab they wish to receive, as vaccine hesitancy appears to be increasing.<br /><br />&quot;In this particular case, the government locked itself into AstraZeneca way too early, and obviously, for whatever reason, some parts of the community are concerned about getting that jab,&quot; he said.<br /><br />&quot;The government at one stage of course said the Pfizer jab would be saved for the vulnerable and elderly, then it was suddenly changed... it moved around and because of that the community became confused about what was best for them.<br /><br />&quot;So confidence, regardless of the facts or veracity of the arguments, it just became a bit confusing.&quot;{% endraw %}
