This DLC has a brand new story involving the memories of Terrako (eggboi). The first mission is called 'To Zelda's Side': a small time travelling robot travels from a Hyrule ravaged by the Calamity to a Hyrule yet to be destroyed, unaware that Ganon's malice had made the same journey to corrupt the same robot as it slept in order to bring about the Calamity's revival.<br /><br />It really messes with your head.{% endraw %}
