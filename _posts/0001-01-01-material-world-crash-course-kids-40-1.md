{% raw %}So, we know what materials are, but can we make new materials? Or improve the materials we already have? In this episode of Crash Course Kids, Sabrina shows us how Material Scientists are working on these two things today. Also, your cell phone holds the answer. <br /><br />///Standards Used in This Video///<br />5-PS1-3. Make observations and measurements to identify materials based on their properties. [Clarification Statement: Examples of materials to be identified could include baking soda and other powders, metals, minerals, and liquids. Examples of properties could include color, hardness, reflectivity, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, response to magnetic forces, and solubility; density is not intended as an identifiable property.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include density or distinguishing mass and weight.]<br /><br />Want to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?<br />Crash Course Main Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/crashcourse">https://www.youtube.com/crashcourse</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse">https://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/thecrashcourse">http://www.twitter.com/thecrashcourse</a><br />Tumblr - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com">http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com</a><br /><br />Credits...<br />Producer &amp; Editor: Nicholas Jenkins<br />Cinematographer &amp; Director: Michael Aranda<br />Host: Sabrina Cruz<br />Script Supervisor: Mickie Halpern<br />Writer: Kay Boatner<br />Executive Producers: John &amp; Hank Green<br />Consultant: Shelby Alinsky<br />Script Editor: Blake de Pastino<br /><br />Thought Cafe Team:<br />Stephanie Bailis<br />Cody Brown<br />Suzanna Brusikiewicz<br />Jonathan Corbiere<br />Nick Counter<br />Kelsey Heinrichs<br />Jack Kenedy<br />Corey MacDonald<br />Tyler Sammy<br />Nikkie Stinchcombe <br />James Tuer<br />Adam Winnik{% endraw %}
