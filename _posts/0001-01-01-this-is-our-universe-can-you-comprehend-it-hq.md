{% raw %}If one thinks about how small the earth on wich we live is , compared to the vast universe, one could come to the conclusion that our home planet is our lifeboat, floating threw an infinite space, giving us all that we need! We are one with this earth and the universe! We are one as a people! We are one as life! Everything that devides us today should unite us! All the differences we see about eachother are nothing, when we think and feel that we are one human family, sharing a little blue dot, our shelter. Can we remember who we are? One!<br /><br /><br /><br />The time to see that all wars, greed, hatred, and destruction, is destroying all of us! If we work together and open our minds, this little blue dot could be more beautiful and peaceful then we can hardly imagine living in todays systems!<br /><br /><br /><br />Look at yourself and see the similarities to all humans and life on earth! Revolutionize your thoughts and minds, and love yourself enough to understand the other!<br /><br /><br /><br />This is OUR universe! We are watching and experiencing it from OUR earth!<br /><br /><br /><br />Peace with Love....and Technology<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />downloaded from youtube.com/philhellenes{% endraw %}
