{% raw %}As a beginner gardener, I was able to preserve A LOT of food this year while simultaneously working a full time job and taking grad classes in the evenings. It was exhausting, but now we get to sit back and enjoy the fruits of our labor (literally). I'm not a perfect canner/preserver, but I am always learning! Next year I hope to do even more.
