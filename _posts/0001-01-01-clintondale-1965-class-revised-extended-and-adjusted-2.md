{% raw %}50 years ago these fine people graduated. Recently, the 50th reunion was held and a relatively large number were able to attend. More slide shows to follow. Thank you Thin Lizzy, The Blues Brothers,  The Who, and YouTube for the music as well as Face Book for the photos. Being a member of that class, I have many fine and fond memories. Some classmates have passed and will always remain in our hearts.<br /> If anyone is not included, kindly let me know and this will be adjusted accordingly.. It's wonderful being human. Thanks for viewing. To reiterate, more to follow upon obtaining as many photos of the reunion as possible.{% endraw %}
