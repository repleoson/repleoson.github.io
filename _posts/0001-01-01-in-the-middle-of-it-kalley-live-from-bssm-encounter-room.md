{% raw %}Kalley Heiligenthal leads her recent release, &quot;In the Middle of It,&quot; in a moving moment of worship live at Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry’s Encounter Room. <br /><br />During the song, there is a powerful moment of prayer led by Second Year Revival Group Pastor, Jess Butcher, where we are invited to remember the steadfast nature of our Lord. <br /><br />He is with you right where you are!<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />Where are You when the wildfire is taking ground?<br />Where are You when the wind comes and knocks us down?<br />Where are You when the waters rise and it looks like we're gonna drown?<br />Where are You now? Where are You now?<br /><br />Where are You in the questions, the in-between?<br />And where are You in the waiting and the unseen?<br />Where are You in the aftermath surrounded by debris?<br />Where are You now? Where are You now?<br /><br />Right in the middle of it, right in the middle of it<br />That's where You'll be found<br />Right in the middle of it, deep in the center of it<br />That's where You are now<br />You'll be right in the middle<br />You'll be right in the middle<br /><br />You are there on the front lines and the retreat<br />You are there in the chaos and in the peace<br />You are there in the victory and You hold us in defeat<br />That's where You are are, that's where You are<br /><br />Sure in the storm, fixed in the flood<br />Oh, You will never run<br />That's who You are, there through it all<br />Our God is here with us<br />Sure in the storm, fixed in the flood<br />Oh, You will never run<br />That's who You are, there through it all<br />Our God is here with us<br /><br />---------<br /><br />In response to what is going on in our world, the Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry (BSSM) pastors and leaders have gathered together (with two or more, but less than 10), to unite us in seeking King Jesus, contending for breakthrough, and hosting the presence of God online.<br /><br />This moment was recorded at Bethel Church on March 26, 2020, live at Encounter Room from BSSM. For the next several weeks, we invite you to stream Encounter Room live on Thursdays from 2-3:30 pm PDT. Our heart is that this would be an invitation for you to encounter the Holy Spirit and experience His love, healing, and peace that passes understanding.<br /><br />Find worship, teachings, and resources from BSSM to equip you to disciple the nations here on our channel.
