{% raw %}A lot of People asked me in comment section to change my anvil so, I bought a new Anvil but I could not waste my previous one so, the best idea I got to utilise my anvil was to turn it into something cool. And I think this is the best hammer I could make from such a heavy anvil.<br /><br />This video took me more than a month to complete because I faced a lot of difficulties while making this video. And it was my first time to do such a crazy machining on a big steel block. I tried my best on this Thor's hammer I hope you will like this made.<br />Maybe I will also post a full length video of this Thor's Hammer.<br /><br />Thor's hammer weight = 12.6KG or about 28 Pounds<br /><br />Turning an Old ANVIL into a Heavy THOR'S HAMMER<br />#Thor'sHammer<br />#RandomHands<br /><br />Our Instagram =  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/random.hands/﻿">https://www.instagram.com/random.hands/﻿</a><br />Youtube Channel = www.youtube.com/randomhands<br />Our Facebook = <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/randomhands">https://www.facebook.com/randomhands</a><br />Youtube Subscription:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrI3dm4qgAEV67Jc6797WIA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrI3dm4qgAEV67Jc6797WIA?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Like, Subscribe &amp; SHARE the video also comment your opinions.<br />Hope you Enjoyed the Video.
