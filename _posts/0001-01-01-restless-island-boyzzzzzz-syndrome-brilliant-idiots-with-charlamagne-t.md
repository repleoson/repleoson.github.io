From power 105's hit radio show &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; comes Charlamagne tha God and stand up comedy's rulebreaker, Andrew Schulz. From music, comedy, relationships, to pop culture, politics and current events, everything is on the table for analysis. But take what you hear with a grain of salt, because while their perspectives are often brilliant, they're liable to be idiotic too.<br /><br />Follow the idiots on social:<br /><br />Charlamagne tha God<br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2XOv2wM">http://bit.ly/2XOv2wM</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2LnhLth">http://bit.ly/2LnhLth</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2XVpuAp">http://bit.ly/2XVpuAp</a><br /><br />Andrew Schulz<br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2XLG6iV">http://bit.ly/2XLG6iV</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2M0LlEB">http://bit.ly/2M0LlEB</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2JIgTMC">http://bit.ly/2JIgTMC</a><br /><br />AlexxMedia<br />Book Studio Time - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/OL2Ny1I--rk">https://youtu.be/OL2Ny1I--rk</a><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/alexxmedia/">https://www.instagram.com/alexxmedia/</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/alexxmedia">https://twitter.com/alexxmedia</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/alexxandersonmedia">https://www.facebook.com/alexxandersonmedia</a><br /><br />Get tickets to Andrew Schulz LIVE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.theandrewschulz.com">https://www.theandrewschulz.com</a><br /><br />Join the discussion on the Idiots subreddit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2XGmsou">http://bit.ly/2XGmsou</a><br /><br />Order Andrew's first comedy album &quot;5:5:1&quot;:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2LA9NKi">https://bit.ly/2LA9NKi</a><br /><br />Order Charlamagnes second book, &quot;Shook One&quot;:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2H6YZ2S">https://amzn.to/2H6YZ2S</a><br /><br />#BrilliantIdiots #Charlamagne #AndrewSchulz<br /><br />New York native and internationally touring stand-up, Andrew Schulz is known for his hilarious and unsafe comedy.
