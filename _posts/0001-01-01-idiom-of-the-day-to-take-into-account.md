{% raw %}Idiom of the day: to take into account <br />Watch this video to understand the meaning of the idiom ðŸ˜€ ðŸ¤“ ðŸ™‚<br />#english #vocabulary #englishwithvlad<br />Transcript:<br />&quot;Hello, dear friends! I have a new portion of English for you today! Today it's an expression: &quot;To take into account&quot;. To take into account means to remember to consider someone or something when making a plan for the future. Imagine a conversation between two business partners: <br />- I think we are finally ready with our plan for Ukraine.<br />- Hey, but have you taken into account the upcoming elections there?<br />- Oh, yeah, that is a good idea to think about.<br />So, that is the phrase &quot;to take into account&quot; - to consider someone or something when making a plan for the future. Okay? Thanks for watching! I'll see you next time, Good bye!<br />***********<br />FOLLOW ME HERE:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://buff.ly/2HrgKhK">https://buff.ly/2HrgKhK</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://buff.ly/2TYNrsM">https://buff.ly/2TYNrsM</a><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://buff.ly/2TTUEdI">https://buff.ly/2TTUEdI</a> <br />Subscribe to this channel and turn on notifications to get all my latest videos.{% endraw %}
