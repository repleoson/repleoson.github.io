{% raw %}English lyrics：<br /><br />Days of My Past (童年) - 贵族乐团 (Noble Band)<br /><br />Lyrics by：罗大佑<br /><br />Composed by：罗大佑<br /><br />I recall when I was young oh<br /><br />I will play and always having fun<br /><br />With the neighbor next to me<br /><br />And we'll play until the setting sun<br /><br />Try to be the best among the others<br /><br />In a game call the spider battle<br /><br />It doesn't matter who is the best now<br /><br />Those were the days of may past<br /><br />Few years later when I got to school<br /><br />And was late for lesson all the time<br /><br />Always day dreaming in the class till<br /><br />I don't even know the lesson's done<br /><br />Then my teacher always tell<br /><br />Me never ever be lazy again<br /><br />What can I do now<br /><br />What can I say now<br /><br />Those were the days of my past<br /><br />As the days go on and on<br /><br />I grew up and had my first love<br /><br />Candle light and sandy beach<br /><br />Finally give away my first kiss<br /><br />Mother said I was too young to<br /><br />Fall in love and then I will one day regret<br /><br />So love was over but I do miss her<br /><br />Those were the days of my past<br /><br />Just when I left my high school and<br /><br />Got my first job in a salesman<br /><br />Working hard all day and night<br /><br />No one there to lend a helping hand<br /><br />Daddy told me not to worry<br /><br />And said that I should go on step by step<br /><br />What can I say now what can<br /><br />I do now those were the days of my past<br /><br />Then once day I settled down<br /><br />With the only one I really love<br /><br />Got a small family with two kids<br /><br />That is what I'm always hoping for<br /><br />But I still remember having fun with all my friends<br /><br />When I was young<br /><br />I miss my home town<br /><br />I miss my old friends<br /><br />Those were the days of my past<br /><br />Oh I miss my home town<br /><br />I miss my old friends<br /><br />When will I see them again{% endraw %}
