{% raw %}Not a day goes by when I don't get asked the question: is the housing market going to crash in 2021. Today we're looking at ALL the data and interpreting it to the best of our ability. It can be pretty scary news to hear that foreclosures are up 27 percent between this month and last, and even scarier to hear that they're up over 60% from last year! BUT, it's important to look at context. We had a pandemic related moratorium on foreclosures for all of 2020, so of course those numbers are up now that that moratorium has expired. <br /><br />Also important to note- people have far more equity in their homes now than they did in 2008. This is important because someone with equity has choices when it comes to foreclosures. <br /><br />00:00 Is the Housing Market Going to Crash<br />05:12 Foreclosure Update<br />07:10 Inventory Issues<br />11:44 What is happening with Interest Rates<br /><br />If you have any questions, please reach out.
