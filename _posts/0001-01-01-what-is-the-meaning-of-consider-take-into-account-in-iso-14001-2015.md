{% raw %}In this episode, I look at an ISO/TC 207/SC1 Interpretation addressing the question: “In some places in the Standard, the organization is directed to take certain items into account, while in other places in the Standard, the organization is directed to “consider” certain items. Is there a difference?”<br /><br />The video covers the question raised through American National Standards Institute (ANSI) &amp; the interpretation response published by the ISO/TC 207/SC1.<br /><br />The ISO/TC 207/SC 1 interpretation is important to ensure consistent understanding of the word &quot;consider&quot; and &quot;take into account&quot; when using ISO 14001:2015 as the basis of your Environmental Management System (EMS)<br /><br />QUESTION<br />Have a question about the use of &quot;consider&quot; &amp; &quot;take into account&quot; in the use of ISO 14001:2015?
