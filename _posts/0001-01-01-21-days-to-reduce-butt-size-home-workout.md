{% raw %}If you think you have a larger-than-normal buttocks then you can reduce butt size easily at home by doing this 21-day workout challenge.<br /><br />It contains easy to follow body-weight exercises and will help you target your lower body area to consume the fat from that muscle group.<br /><br />And you'll also be doing cardio full body exercises that will help boost your circulation and metabolism, requiring your body even more energy to sustain your physical effort.<br /><br />That energy comes from &quot;calories&quot; you consume from food, and also from fat deposits your body creates.<br /><br />This in turn will give you a nice, easy weight-loss effect! But the key here is to exercise on a daily basis, for at least 21-days with this home workout!<br /><br />The result will be a nicer, more toned and lean butt and a reduced body fat indicator.<br /><br />Good luck and don't forget to subscribe to the channel if you want to receive new video workouts everyday from Monday to Friday.<br /><br />Let's begin the challenge and leave me a comment below the video when you've finished training! Tell me how you feel and what is your progress!üí™‚ù§Ô∏è{% endraw %}
