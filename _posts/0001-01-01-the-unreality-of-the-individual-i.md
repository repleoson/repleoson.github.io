{% raw %}In September 2021 I chatted with Simon Rilling, a German podcaster who hosts video interviews with various spiritual figures. Being very new to Bhagavan's teachings, he wanted clarifications on various aspects of what Sri Ramana had to say about the Self and the means by which it could be discovered.<br /><br />Simon's podcast can be found here:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simonrilling.com/podcast​">https://simonrilling.com/podcast​</a><br /><br />His version of the conversation, with German subtitles, is available on Youtube:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rns9CHLWEKI&amp;t=772s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rns9CHLWEKI&amp;t=772s</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.davidgodman.org">https://www.davidgodman.org</a>{% endraw %}
