It was discovered by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace though Darwin championed the idea in his book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;.<br /><br />Natural selection can be defined as the process by which random evolutionary changes are selected for by nature in a consistent, orderly, non-random way.<br /><br />When coupled with descent with modification, Natural Selection can cause a population to evolve for fitness within a given environment over multiple generations.<br /><br />Natural Selection is an observable fact. By carefully observing populations of living things with short life cycles you can actually watch it happen.<br /><br />Want to learn more? Check out our notes for this video.
