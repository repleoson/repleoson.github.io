{% raw %}This Model (ROS Mapped CM Model) shows why the speed of light is a constant without mathematics.  This video asks two questions that a layperson may ask then answers them using this animated model. Question 1: How can the speed be constant when all objects can travel at different velocities? Question 2: Why can't the speed of light be exceeded by adding velocities of two objects traveling in opposite directions? This is the animation of Special Relativity that Albert Einstein never made.  <br />For more info see my supplement &quot;Time Dilation Without Math&quot; JEffnFsthfg and go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://rosmappedcmmodel.com/">http://rosmappedcmmodel.com/</a>{% endraw %}
