Cut out all sugars.<br />2. Cut out all snacks<br />3. Reduce the frequency of eating to 2-3 meals.<br />4. Add more fat to go longer without eating. Fat does not raise insulin like sugars and protein.<br />5. Increase potassium foods - vegetables<br />6. Increase the B-vitamins from nutritional yeast.<br /><br />Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:<br />Dr. Berg, 56 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.
