The palmar grasp reflex is elicited by applying gentle pressure onto or by horizontally stroking the infant's palm. In response, the infant will close the palm or make a fist. The plantar grasp reflex is elicited similarly by application of gentle pressure to the soles of the infant's feet, which triggers plantar flexion (curling in) of the toes. Unilateral absence of the palmar grasp indicates a brachial plexus or peripheral nerve injury. Bilateral  absence of the palmar and/or plantar grasp reflex is suggestive of cerebral palsy. <br /><br />Subscribe to AMBOSS YouTube for the latest clinical examination videos, medical student interviews, study tips and tricks, and live webinars!<br /><br />Free 5 Day Trial: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.amboss.com/amboss-YT">https://go.amboss.com/amboss-YT</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/amboss_med/">https://www.instagram.com/amboss_med/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AMBOSS.Med/">https://www.facebook.com/AMBOSS.Med/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ambossmed">https://twitter.com/ambossmed</a><br />Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.amboss.com/us">https://blog.amboss.com/us</a><br /><br />#AMBOSSMed #Pediatrics #USMLE{% endraw %}
