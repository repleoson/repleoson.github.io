How about a sleepy face? Can you make an excited face? Let‚Äôs see a silly face! This song is great for teaching emotions. For young developing speakers, it‚Äôs great for introducing vocabulary to help express how they are feeling. For children who have challenges recognizing and reading facial expressions, it‚Äôs a great chance to become familiar with a variety of physical emotional cues in a fun way. And everybody gets to make faces! üé∂ This is a happy face. This is a happy face. This is a happy face.
