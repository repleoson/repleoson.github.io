{% raw %}NASA's next Mars rover has a name – Perseverance. Like every exploration mission before, our rover is going to face challenges, and it’s going to make amazing discoveries. <br /><br />The time at hand is hard. We have already surmounted many obstacles on our way to Red Planet, but as humans we will not give up. We will always persevere. <br /><br />Targeted for launch in July 2020, NASA’s Mars Perseverance rover will search for signs of habitable conditions on Mars in the ancient past and for signs of past microbial life itself.<br /><br />Learn more about the mission: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/">https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/</a><br /><br />Produced by brother<br />Directed by Theodore Melfi<br />Narrated by Octavia Spencer <br /><br />Music Credit: RONE - MOTION III <br />Composed and produced by Erwan Castex<br />Arranged by Romain Allender <br />Performed by Rone, Vanessa Wagner &amp; Les siècles Orchestra <br />iF3073 - ℗ &amp; © 2018 InFiné<br />Published by InFiné Éditions / Warner Chappell Music Publishing{% endraw %}
