{% raw %}This video podcast was never meant to have the title are New Zealand people funny...but as you'll soon see,  this isn't your normal show.<br /><br />We met this week's guests through Youtube. One minute we were talking on the phone and then nek minit we are all on the couch in the Naki drinking tea.<br /><br />We had full intentions of doing a proper grown-up interview, discussing MƒÅori culture and life in New Zealand but laughter got in the way and the conversations went sideways leading to us talk instead about: Is the New Zealand accent sexy, Coronation Street, Rugby, chat up lines and much, much more. <br />We hope that you love the show as much as we loved spending time with these two gorgeous people! ‚ù§Ô∏è<br /><br />Remember!
