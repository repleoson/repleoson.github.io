{% raw %}Steam trains in America!  This coal burning steam locomotive is on an old Pennsylvania Railroad line in Ohio with a caboose and 3 passenger cars.  It is the first steam train on this branch line railroad in Lebanon, Ohio in 2 years.  This is the Lebanon, Mason &amp; Monroe Railroad just north of Cincinnati, Ohio and south of Dayton.  Diesel trains normally operate on this tourist line railroad.  It ties into the Indiana &amp; Ohio Railway near Mason, Ohio.  Trains operate on 161.385 and there is no freight service on this line.  The steam engine is Lehigh Valley Coal #126 and was built in May of 1931 by Vulcan Iron Works in Pennsylvania.  It was restored by father and son team John &amp; Barney Gramling and travels by truck to various railroads around the USA.  It uses about 100 pounds of coal and 100 gallons of water per mile.  It made round trips on this line that totaled about 6 and a half miles each.  The Gramlings are from north east Indiana and have several other steam locomotives.  This is Part 1 of 2 parts and is filmed in 4K.  Part 2 will be posted in about a week.<br />   Filmed August 7, 2021<br />    Thanks for watching!   <br />Please thumbs up and watch another JawTooth video to help my channel.<br /><br />My First Big Boy 2021 Video!!  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbf3DpYLD3g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbf3DpYLD3g</a><br /><br />      Check out my steam train playlist for some really cool videos including the Big Boy!
