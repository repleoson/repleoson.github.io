What makes these ''caught on camera'' moments so scary is the fact that they were filmed in places like  south africa, safaris, kruger national park, zimbabwe and other african plaines.<br /><br />Some of these clips feature moments where tourists get their boat charged by an angry hippo, two fishermen get attacked by a hippo, a brave russian man chases a hippo, kayakers have a close call with a hippo, two men in a car get chased by a hippo and a group of young fishermen get stalked by hippos.<br /><br />Some of these creepy videos even feature moments where people were chased down by these animals, which are known to attack or stalk people who are out camping, hunting or hiking or just exploring the safari.<br /><br />These hippo vs man moments are sure to give you the chills and the fact that some people were lucky enough to capture these near death experiences on gopros ou on tape makes it even scarier.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: All materials in these videos are used for entertainment purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
