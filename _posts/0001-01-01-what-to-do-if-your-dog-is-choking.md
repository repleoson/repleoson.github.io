{% raw %}A man was playing catch with his dog Hansel, when the ball the man was throwing got lodged in the dog’s throat. Hansel was rushed to the veterinarian, but started turning blue in the car on the way there. Once at the West Hills Animal Hospital, Dr. Kristie Williams performed a sort of Heimlich maneuver for dogs, coaxing the stuck ball out of Hansel’s throat. The term has been coined the external extraction technique, and Dr. Williams says every dog owner should know how to do it.{% endraw %}
