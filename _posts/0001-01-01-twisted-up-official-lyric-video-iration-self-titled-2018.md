{% raw %}www.iration.fm/self-titled-2018<br /><br />&quot;We’ve always been a band with very eclectic influences. We’ve never shied away from exploring different styles or sounds. We’ve always said that we don’t care what “genre” a song fits into, we just care that we serve the song and let IT dictate where we go. This album was 2 years in the making and is what we consider the definitive sound of Iration. You’ll hear all of our influences being channeled and it might take you a few listens before you hear them all. In the meantime, we hope you enjoy the ride.&quot; <br /><br />- Micah Pueschel<br /><br />LYRICS:<br /><br />VERSE 1<br />It's gone far enough<br />I thought that I was tough<br />But I still feel tied down<br />I know you lied to me <br />Call you on the phone and you let it ring<br />If things ain't adding up<br />Things ain't adding up<br /><br />CHORUS<br />You got me twisted up, twisted up<br />Don't know what to do now<br />Twisted up, twisted up<br />Never been so twisted up twisted up<br />Don't know what is true now<br />Twisted up <br />Inside<br /><br />VERSE 2<br />I'm not going this road<br />How did you get so cold?<br />Can't you see I'm hurting?<br />You took my heart and you tore it out<br />Played me like fool when I'm out of luck<br />If things weren't bad enough<br />If things weren't bad enough{% endraw %}
