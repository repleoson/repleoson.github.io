Pastor Allen Jackson shows examples from the Bible of how God‚Äôs Truth, declared in the light of current circumstances, moves peoples‚Äô hearts towards God. Our assignment is to be diligent workers in the body of Christ, to grow God's Kingdom, and to be salt and light within our schools, churches, cities, states, and nation.
