She's such an angel<br />But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus]<br />Walks by<br />What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky<br />She's got you mesmerized while I die<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Why would you ever kiss me?<br />I'm not even half as pretty<br />You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester<br />But you like her better<br />(I wish I were Heather)<br /><br />[Bridge]<br />(Oh) Wish I were Heather<br />(Oh, oh) Wish I were Heather<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Why would you ever kiss me?<br />I'm not even half as pretty<br />You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester<br />But you like her better<br />Wish I were<br /><br />Conan Gray - Heather (Lyrics)<br /><br />#ConanGray #Heather #TajTracks{% endraw %}
