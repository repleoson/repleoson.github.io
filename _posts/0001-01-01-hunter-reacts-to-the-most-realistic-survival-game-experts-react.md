{% raw %}Expert Hunter Tim ‘Spike’ Davis makes his return today reacting to the post-apocalyptic survival game The Long Dark where you must do what you can to survive. The Long Dark has a range of animals out in the wilderness you can use to hunt and harvest for resources so who better to come in and review this great game? Tim takes us through different processes and the impracticality of some weapons when it comes to wild hunting and which animals are and aren’t really worth the hassle in the long run. Any The Long Dark fans tuning in today what did you think?<br /><br />The Long Dark takes place in an open-world environment and is played from the first-person perspective. In the game, the player assumes the role of a crash-landed pilot who must survive after a geomagnetic storm in the frozen Canadian wilderness. There are a number of regions in the environment, all of which are interconnected. According to the developers, the gameplay is a &quot;survival simulation that takes into account factors such as body temperature, hunger/thirst, fatigue, wildlife, and many other factors.&quot;<br /><br />#TheLongDark #Hunter #ExpertsReact<br />--------------------<br />Tim ‘Spike’ Davis:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/timspikedavis/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/timspikedavis/?hl=en</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.scatteredthoughtscartoons.com/">https://www.scatteredthoughtscartoons.com/</a><br />--------------------<br />﻿﻿﻿﻿0:00 - Intro<br />﻿0:43 - Rabbit Hunting<br />﻿2:41 - Wolf Hunting<br />﻿3:36 - Deer Hunting<br />﻿5:55 - Deer Hunting with a Revolver<br />﻿7:49 - Bear Hunting<br />﻿8:28 - Bear Hunting with a Bow and Arrow<br />﻿9:25 - Moose Hunting<br />﻿11:11 - Outro<br />--------------------<br />Check out some of our past videos!<br /><br />Hunter REACTS to Red Dead Redemption 2 | Experts React<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/7eKdAFlOkJI">https://youtu.be/7eKdAFlOkJI</a><br /><br />Spec Ops REACT to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare - Night Missions Campaign | Experts React<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/7_pph8Ilq1E">https://youtu.be/7_pph8Ilq1E</a><br />--------------------<br />Thanks to MyUsualMe - Daily Games for the gameplay:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MyUsualMe">https://www.youtube.com/c/MyUsualMe</a><br /><br />Part of the gameplay was done by Gamology<br />--------------------<br />Up In My Jam (All Of A Sudden) by - Kubbi <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/kubbi">https://soundcloud.com/kubbi</a><br />Creative Commons — Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported— CC BY-SA 3.0 <br />Free Download / Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2JnDfCE">http://bit.ly/2JnDfCE</a><br />Music promoted by Audio Library <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/tDexBj46oNI">https://youtu.be/tDexBj46oNI</a><br />--------------------<br />Stay in the loop with us on social media!<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thebestofgaming1/">https://www.facebook.com/thebestofgaming1/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gamology/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/gamology/?hl=en</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gamologyus">https://twitter.com/gamologyus</a>{% endraw %}
