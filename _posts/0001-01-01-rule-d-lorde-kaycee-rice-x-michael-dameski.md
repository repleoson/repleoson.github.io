{% raw %}In life, we encounter so many battles and we choose to cope with them each differently. We can either choose to let our inner demons control us, or we can gather the courage to use our weaknesses to gain strength. You are the only person who decides who controls your life. Strength is in all of us, we just have to keep fightingðŸ–¤<br /><br />So inspired by Michael and grateful to have been apart of this video and creating it! We wanted to do something a bit different, incorporating strength, power, and storytelling all in one.<br /><br />Concept/Choreography by Kaycee Rice &amp; Michael Dameski<br />Creative Direction by @Michael Dameski Official Channel <br />Captured by @FULLOUTTV <br />Music by @theworldwidesound - @Lorde #everybodywantstoruletheworld<br /><br />My SOCIALs<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kayceericeo...">https://www.instagram.com/kayceericeo...</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/kayceerice">https://twitter.com/kayceerice</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/KayceeRiceOf...">https://www.facebook.com/KayceeRiceOf...</a><br />Youtube (2nd channel): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/kayceericeoff...">https://www.youtube.com/kayceericeoff...</a><br />Apparel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.weirdoapparel.com/">https://www.weirdoapparel.com/</a>{% endraw %}
