{% raw %}It's been a while since I posted! I needed to take a break from YouTube to figure out my life, and I wanted to update you on what I've been up to. Back in April of 2021, I pulled the trigger on a brand new white Ram Promaster 2500 and started converting it into a campervan, aka tiny house on wheels! Very excited for that! Once the van is done, I'll definitely share more about the costs, buildout, plus a full van tour, so stay tuned. But for now, I wanted to share about some of my recent major life decisions and the financial reasoning behind these decisions. So cozy up and let's do some catching up!<br /><br />__________<br /><br />***FREE TRAINING: The 3 Secrets to Investing in Times of Uncertainty <br />How to build wealth on autopilot, even if you're scared, totally confused by financial jargon, and tend to get stuck in “analysis paralysis”.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rosehan.com/investing">https://www.rosehan.com/investing</a>    ←  SIGN UP HERE<br /><br />__________ <br /><br />***BOOKS I RECOMMEND*** <br /><br />I Will Teach You to Be Rich (hilarious how-to book on personal finance for millennials) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2VbJ1Pt">https://amzn.to/2VbJ1Pt</a> <br /><br />The Little Book of Common Sense Investing (Jack Bogle's classic advice on index funds) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/32ewzjj">https://amzn.to/32ewzjj</a> <br /><br />InvestED (step-by-step, millennial-friendly advice on how to pick stocks like Warren Buffett) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SLTYpn">https://amzn.to/2SLTYpn</a> <br /><br />Unshakeable (this book = courage. blast ALL the fears &amp; misconceptions you have about investing) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SKyklt">https://amzn.to/2SKyklt</a> <br /><br />Rich Dad Poor Dad (#1 selling personal finance book of all time... need I say more?) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SJ6vtx">https://amzn.to/2SJ6vtx</a> <br /><br />Think and Grow Rich (the ultimate book on money mindset and wealth consciousness) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/37N2adc">https://amzn.to/37N2adc</a> <br /><br />__________<br /><br />DISCLAIMERS &amp; DISCLOSURES ❤<br /><br />This content is for education and entertainment purposes only.
