{% raw %}When Becca and Tyler are sent to their grandparents' secluded Pennsylvania farm for a weeklong stay, they quickly discover something is not right with the elderly couple. Faced with strange rules and increasingly frightening behavior, the children soon realize it will take all their wits to make it home alive. Critics rave, the latest heart-pounding thriller from the director of The Sixth Sense and Signs and the producer of Paranormal Activity and The Purge is a “deliciously creepy triumph.”** **Scott Mendelson, Forbes.com (Original Title - The Visit) - 2015 Universal Studios.
