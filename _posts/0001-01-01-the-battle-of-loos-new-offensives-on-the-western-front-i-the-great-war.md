{% raw %}After weeks of preparation the French and British Armies unleash a new offensive on the Western Front. Not only is it supposed to relieve pressure on the Russians on the Eastern Front but the Entente wants to achieve the decisive breakthrough. The French actually break through German trenches only to realise that they have a second line of trenches completely in tact right behind the first line. The British attack at Loos also turns into carnage even though the British use gas for the first time.  <br /><br />» HOW CAN I SUPPORT YOUR CHANNEL?<br />You can support us by sharing our videos with your friends and spreading the word about our work.You can also support us financially on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/thegreatwar">https://www.patreon.com/thegreatwar</a><br /><br />Patreon is a platform for creators like us, that enables us to get monthly financial support from the community in exchange for cool perks. <br /><br />» MORE HISTORY? <br />Check out our sister channel IT’S HISTORY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/itshistory">http://youtube.com/itshistory</a><br /><br />» WHERE CAN I GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WORLD WAR I AND WHERE ELSE CAN I FIND YOU? <br />We’re offering background knowledge, news, a glimpse behind the scenes and much more on: <br />reddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/TheGreatSubReddit">http://bit.ly/TheGreatSubReddit</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/WW1FB">http://bit.ly/WW1FB</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/WW1Series">http://bit.ly/WW1Series</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/ZpMYPL">http://bit.ly/ZpMYPL</a><br /><br />» CAN I EMBED YOUR VIDEOS ON MY WEBSITE? <br />Of course, you can embed our videos on your website.
