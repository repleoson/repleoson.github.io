{% raw %}“Why does it always happen to me?” “Their life is so perfect, nothing ever goes wrong for them!” We rage to ourselves, in our quest to make sense of an unfair world. But how do we learn to accept the unavoidable pitfalls of life and still create one we love? Holly shares her own personal journey of resilience building and reminds you that you’re not bad luck, it isn’t just you and how accepting life’s ‘below the belt’ moments and being happy anyway, will make you an unshakeable force and allow you to live your best life. Activist, Motivational Speaker This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
