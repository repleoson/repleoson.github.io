The track not only raised the curtain for â€˜MOSAIIKâ€™, but also raced to become Cosmic Gateâ€™s fastest release to reach a million Spotify streams. <br /><br />If â€˜Blameâ€™s taught us anything itâ€™s that Dianaâ€™s a singer who wears her heart resolutely on sleeve, and â€˜Nothing To Hideâ€™ retains the same authenticity and disarming honesty that lent â€˜Blameâ€™ its expressive electricity. â€˜Nothingâ€™s lyrics are a meaningful meditation on the walls we unknowingly build and the trust needed to bring them down. Again, Diana translates thoughts-to-song in a fashion that delivers equal parts emotive heft and wildfire catchiness, ensuring her refrains sit long in the mind. <br /><br />Through their studio work, Nic &amp; Bossi channel the emotional tussle of Dianaâ€™s words perfectly, covering them innately in a cooler trance wrap. Beat by beat, they echo her open-hearted contemplations, only latterly - through the dropâ€™s epically stunning piano solo - marking â€˜Nothing To Hideâ€™s revelatory tipping point. <br /><br />A piece of music that feels as personal as they come, yet poignantly resonates real-world, every day, you-&amp;-I themes with an almost uncanny intuition, â€˜Nothing To Hideâ€™ releases today. <br /><br />Join the Black Hole Recordings community ðŸš€<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/blackholerecordings/">https://www.facebook.com/blackholerecordings/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/blackholerecordings/">https://www.instagram.com/blackholerecordings/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BlackHoleRec">https://twitter.com/BlackHoleRec</a><br />Let's Dance Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blackhole.complete.me/letsdance">https://blackhole.complete.me/letsdance</a><br />Trancefamily playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blackhole.complete.me/trancefamily">https://blackhole.complete.me/trancefamily</a><br /><br />#CosmicGate #DianaMiro #BlackHoleRecordings{% endraw %}
