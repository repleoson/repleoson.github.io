{% raw %}We’re not as ethical as we think we are. And, if we realize it, we have a better chance of being better. Fashion Ethicist Morgan Hamel shares her own personal struggle with the ethics of egg donation, as well as dilemmas in her fashion business and an unusual interaction with Andy Fastow from Enron to show that understanding the role of self-interest is key to becoming the individuals and companies we already think we are. Morgan Hamel started The Garment to connect women and responsible brands. Her company brings together women who are interested in owning fewer, better pieces and the companies who make them. Her work is about more than just clothing—it’s about community. After studying ethics in school, and working in the ethics office of a large corporation, she learned just how much grey area there can be. She created a business model based on her experience that is changing the face of fashion. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
