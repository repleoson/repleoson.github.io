{% raw %}Dr Bob brings you SCP Foundation Euclid class object, SCP-002 The Living Room Animation.<br /><br />LIKE, SUBSCRIBE, and turn on NOTIFICATIONS to DrBob Channel Today!<br /><br />SCP-002 resembles a tumorous, fleshy growth with a volume of roughly 60 meters cubed. An iron valve hatch on one side leads to its interior, which appears to be a standard low-rent apartment of modest size. One wall of SCP 002 possesses a single window, though no such opening is visible from the exterior. The room contains furniture which, upon close examination, appears to be sculpted bone, woven hair, and various other biological substances produced by the human body. All matter tested thus far show independent or fragmented DNA sequences for each object in SCP002.<br /><br />Watch ALL of DrBob's videos including SCP-4666 The Yule Man and SCP-3700 Tides of War here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHxBeJ7z3xRleoXfcoFZxHgqji3jKgWwV">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHxBeJ7z3xRleoXfcoFZxHgqji3jKgWwV</a><br /><br />Watch TheRubber videos if you like these, this video was inspired by The Rubber animation style:<br /><br />SCP-387 Living Lego (SCP Animation)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MVUh28Xd_U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MVUh28Xd_U</a><br /><br />SCP-3166 Gorefield (SCP Animation)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MseCvkQfwk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MseCvkQfwk</a><br /><br />This video, being derived from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-002">http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-002</a> written by Unknown Author, is released under Creative Commons Sharealike 3.0. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</a><br /><br />Narrated by Joe Cliff Thompson<br />#drbob #scp #animation{% endraw %}
