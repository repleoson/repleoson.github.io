{% raw %}Quantum theory explains how particles and fields work. General relativity, discovered by Einstein, explains how gravity generates the structure of the universe. But the two great theories of physics and cosmology are not compatible. But this is impossible because both describe reality. Only a solution to quantum gravity can solve the huge problem.<br /> <br />Free access to Closer to Truth's library of 5,000 videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/376lkKN">http://bit.ly/376lkKN</a><br /> <br />Watch more interviews on Quantum Gravity: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3wd6sZe">https://bit.ly/3wd6sZe</a><br /> <br />Nima Arkani-Hamed (born 5 April 1972) is a Canadian/American theoretical physicist with interests in high-energy physics, string theory and cosmology.
