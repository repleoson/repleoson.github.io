{% raw %}You are so much more than what your grades or experience say about you, remember it.<br /><br />In this video, I share my journey through University from when I decided to become a Consultant, more than 3 years ago to when I actually became one.<br /><br />Despite starting off University with the worse grades possible, and no experience, I have achieved my goal. The formula I used is repeatable and that's what I explain in the video. <br /><br />Hopefully, you can achieve your career goal as well!<br /><br />Be clear about what you really want, even if you're not 100% sure, write it down and divide that goal into small &amp; achievable steps. <br /><br />This &quot;simple&quot; strategy got me interviews at the Big 4 Firms (Deloitte, KPMG and PwC, EY didn't have any job postings at that time), IBM, Sunlife, Gorilla Group and more during my last semester even if I didn't have the best grades nor the best internships on my CV (I had none lol).<br /><br />Do you have any questions about PwC, Consulting or anything related? <br />Drop them below! ‚¨á<br />-----------------------------------------------<br />üî∫ Subscribe for More Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2z5V1W0">https://bit.ly/2z5V1W0</a><br /><br />üé•WATCH NEXT:<br />A Day in My Life as a PwC Consultant: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9WtVWNHpnMc">https://youtu.be/9WtVWNHpnMc</a><br /><br />‚úÖ Follow me: <br />LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/mahdikafi<br />Website: www.primalcareer.com<br /><br />ü§ù Want to Work together?<br />Book some time here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://primalcareer.com/services">http://primalcareer.com/services</a><br /><br />üìß Contact Me:<br />For all subscribers, please use this email: hello@primalcareer.com<br />For business inquires only, please use this email: mahdi@primalcareer.com<br /><br />Do You Enjoy My Videos?
