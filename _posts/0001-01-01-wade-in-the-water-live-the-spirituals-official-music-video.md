Morrison, navigated The Spirituals Choir in a time of great uncertainty to give a message of hope. <br /><br />“This is a collection of negro spirituals and songs that have inspired and championed the story of black people. With all that is happening in the world today there has never been a better time for the power of music to bring us together.  This is a commemoration of not only our breakthrough and achievements but also an acknowledgement of the continuous pain and sorrow experienced by Black people today. We must find a way to foster and fight for the justice and equality of Black individuals everywhere. Justice and the good news go hand in hand.” - Junior Garr<br /><br />Join the movement: www.instagram.com/thespiritualsmusic <br /><br />Copyright: Renaissance House London<br />Management: Virtue Music Media<br />Producers: Keith Bazari, David Dankwah-Coffie, Jeremiah Dankwah-Coffie <br />Writers: Junior Garr, Marsha B.
