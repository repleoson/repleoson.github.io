{% raw %}Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are working to push through their ongoing budget battle. Senate Democrats are finalizing the final text of their $3.5 trillion spending bill. But as CBS News' Skyler Henry reports, the Senate Parliamentarian delivered a blow to the party on its immigration plans. This comes as both House and Senate Democrats unveiled a spending measure to avoid a government shutdown coupled with a suspension to the national debt ceiling. Siobhan Hughes, a congressional reporter for The Wall Street Journal, joins CBSN's Elaine Quijano with more on how Republicans are reacting to the plan.<br /><br />CBSN is CBS News’ 24/7 digital streaming news service featuring live, anchored coverage available for free across all platforms.
