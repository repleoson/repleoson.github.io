{% raw %}Happy Valentines Day!<br />“Constant” is a new song written by me and Jesse Barrera, produced by Jesse Barrera for his on-going project this year.<br /><br />I’ve worked with Jesse for many years on a few of my projects including For More Than A Feeling LP, Pixelated EP, Suddenly, and Everything To Lose on my sophomore album, Pause (II). <br />When Jesse asked me to write and sing for his new project, I was honored to be a part of it and “Constant” was the product of that.<br /><br />I hope when you hear this song, it brings you feelings of love, happiness, and remind you of the people who have remained “constant” in your life.<br /><br />Love &amp; Light,<br />Jeremy Passion<br /><br />Check out Jesse Barrera’s work and upcoming projects on Spotify, Apple Music &amp; More.
