{% raw %}UML Component Diagram Cheat Sheet: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/Ybhhu">http://goo.gl/Ybhhu</a><br /><br />Welcome to my tutorial on UML 2.0 Component Diagrams! Blocks of code are set up as components to create reusable blocks of code. Component diagrams are then used to show how components are used to create software systems.<br /><br />On top of covering every symbol associated with component diagrams I decided to also cover Composite Structures. They model how objects work together when a class diagram doesn't cut it. Also relationship arrows are covered again because of your requests.{% endraw %}
