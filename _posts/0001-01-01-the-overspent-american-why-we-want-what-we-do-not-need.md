{% raw %}The Overspent American explores why so many of us feel materially dissatisfied, why we work staggeringly long hours and yet walk around with ever-present mental &quot;wish lists&quot; of things to buy or get, and why Americans save less than virtually anyone in the world. Unlike many experts, Harvard economist Juliet B. Schor does not blame consumers' lack of self-discipline. Nor does she blame advertisers. Instead she analyzes the crisis of the American consumer in a culture where spending has become the ultimate social art. (Based on the Juliet Schor book of the same name).<br />*This video is unmonetized, and is for educational, non-commercial purposes only.*{% endraw %}
