{% raw %}When I put this clip on top of YouTube in 2013, I never expected it to get so many views.  Thanks to everyone who's enjoyed watching this here and liked the video.<br /><br />In case you want to know more about the Society, look here:<br />* <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://montypython.fandom.com/wiki/Society_for_Putting_Things_on_Top_of_Other_Things">https://montypython.fandom.com/wiki/Society_for_Putting_Things_on_Top_of_Other_Things</a><br /><br />This very silly sketch about the Royal Society For Putting Things On Top of Other Things by Monty Python is (C) 1970 Python (Monty) Pictures Limited.  <br /><br />Disclaimer: No copyright infringement is intended, and I do not own or claim to own videos about Royal Societies, nor the world record for putting things on top of other things I tried to do more than 22 and got bit by a moose.{% endraw %}
