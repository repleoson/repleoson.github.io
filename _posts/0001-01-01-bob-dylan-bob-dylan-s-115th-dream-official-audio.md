I said as we hit land.<br />I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.<br />Captain arab he starting writing out some deeds<br />He said let's build us a fort and start buying the place with beads.<br />Just then a cop come down the street crazy as a loon<br />They throws us all in jail for carryin' harpoons.<br />Aw, me, I busted out don't even ask me how,<br />I went lookin' for some help, I walked past a guernsey cow<br />Who directed me down to the bowery slums<br />Where people carried signs around sayin' ban the bums.<br />I jumped right in line, sayin' I hope that I'm not late<br />When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.<br />I went into a restaurant lookin' for the cook<br />I told him I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.<br />The waitress he was handsome and he wore a powder blue cape.<br />I ordered up some suzette, I said could you please make that crepe<br />Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat<br />Food was flyin' everywhere I left without my hat.<br />I didn't mean to be nosy but I went into a bank<br />To get some bail for arab the boys back in the tank.<br />They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.<br />They threw me in the alley, when up comes this girl from france<br />Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend<br />Who knocked me out an' robbed my boots an' was I on the street again.<br />I rapped upon a house with a u.s. flag upon display.<br />I said can you please help me out, I got some friends down the way.<br />The man said get out of here I'll tear you limb from limb.<br />I said you know, they refused jesus, too. he said you're not him.<br />Get out of here before I break your bones. I ain't your pop.<br />I decided to have him arrested and went looking for a cop.<br />I ran right outside and hopped inside a cab<br />I went out the other door this english man said fab<br />As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood<br />Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.<br />I ran right through the front door like a hobo sailor does,<br />But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was<br />I repeated that all my friends were in jail, with a sigh.<br />He gave me his card and said call me if they die.<br />I shook his hand and said goodbye and went back out on the street,<br />When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.<br />A pay phone was ringin' and it just about blew my mind<br />When I picked it up an' said hello, this foot came through the line<br />...<br /><br />#BobDylan #Folk #SingerSongwriter{% endraw %}
