{% raw %}- - Created through FAIR USE for educational purposes - - STS-121<br />You need a sound system with a lot of power and a great sub (turned up to house shaking level) to get the right effect of this video.  I made this for all the people who dreamed of seeing a launch in person but were never able to make the trip themselves.<br /><br />Using dozens of different video sources and countless audio versions of Shuttle launches I mixed this little clip together to mimic as close an experience to the real thing as I could.  I know that the exact sequence of countdown events is somewhat compressed and not time-accurate but I was going more for the 'feel' of a high energy launch experience rather than a technical documentary.  Throttle Up and SRB Separation are sounds as might be heard from onboard acoustic transducers picking up resonant vibration in the vehicle's structure.<br /><br />Please take care not to damage your sound equipment during playback.  I did not do anything to boost the low frequency roar of the Shuttle during liftoff but the SRB and SSME thrust noise may be taxing to even high quality sub-woofers and speaker cones if played too loud.<br /><br />For those who sit through the last few frames you can catch a glimpse of my home theater system I built a couple of years ago.  This video really is best viewed at 165 inches or better!{% endraw %}
