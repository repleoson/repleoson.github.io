{% raw %}How to apply for OPT in 2020? To be clear, your college's international student office will always have the latest information. But today, I want to share what I wish I had known! <br /><br />In this video, I walk you through the complete checklist of every document and cost you need to prepare for before you can even submit the application for post-completion Optional Practical Training. <br /><br />Even if you'll only be applying for OPT one or two years from now — and even if you're not sure whether you even want to apply for OPT yet — it's important to take note of everything you need as early as possible so that you can have enough time to get it done.<br /><br />For example, did you know it costs $550 to apply for OPT? Finding out about this only two months before I needed to apply added so much necessary stress to my senior year, which is already a very stressful time. If I had learned how to apply for OPT much earlier, I could have saved myself a lot of time and money. I could have been much more prepared for the OPT application process. <br /><br />Are you thinking about working in the US after graduation? Is there anything you still don't know about the OPT application process? Let me know in the comments below. <br /><br />While I can answer your questions as best as possible based on my experience, I recommend that you reach out to your school's international student office to confirm that you have all the right information you need. They are the best source. <br /><br />______________<br /><br />ACRONYMS USED IN THIS VIDEO:<br />• OPT — Optional Practical Training<br />• EAD — Employment Authorization Document<br />• USCIS — United States Citizenship for Immigration Services<br /><br /> ______________<br /><br />SAY HI ON INSTAGRAM:<br />@alexxhemmer <br /><br />______________<br /><br />WHAT TO WATCH NEXT: <br />How I Got My Driver's License in the US — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTpD6C8Ih60">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTpD6C8Ih60</a><br />How to Find a Job in the US in 2020 — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1nHIt74gE0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1nHIt74gE0</a><br />Resume Tips for International Students — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFblqO7F8es&amp;t=11s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFblqO7F8es&amp;t=11s</a><br />3 Tips to Secure Your CPT Internship — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VV9jjBlKyQ&amp;t=4s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VV9jjBlKyQ&amp;t=4s</a><br />______________<br /><br />SOUND CREDITS:<br />&quot;Bell, Counter, A.wav&quot; by InspectorJ (www.jshaw.co.uk) of Freesound.org<br />&quot;Swipe Whoosh&quot; by qubodup (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://qubodup.github.io/)">https://qubodup.github.io/)</a> of Freesound.org{% endraw %}
