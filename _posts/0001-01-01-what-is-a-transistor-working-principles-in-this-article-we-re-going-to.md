{% raw %}What is a Transistor? A transistor is a type of a semiconductor device that can be used to both conduct and insulate electric current or voltage. A transistor basically acts as a switch and an amplifier. In simple words, we can say that a transistor is a miniature device that is used to control or regulate the flow of electronic signals.<br /><br />Transistors are one of the key components in most of the electronic devices that are present today. Developed in the year 1947 by three American physicists John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley, the transistor is considered as one of the most important inventions in the history of science.<br /><br />Table of Content<br />#Parts_of_a_Transistor<br />#Types_of_Transistors<br />#How_do_Transistors work?<br />#Characteristics_of_Transistor<br />#Advantages_of_Transistor<br /><br /><br />Follow me:<br /> Facebook:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?...">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?...</a><br /> Likee :<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://likee.com/@pratapyada/?c=cp&amp;b...">https://likee.com/@pratapyada/?c=cp&amp;b...</a> <br /><br />Tiktok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vm.tiktok.com/7ELBdr/">https://vm.tiktok.com/7ELBdr/</a> <br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/?hl=hi">https://www.instagram.com/?hl=hi</a> <br /><br />Twitter: Take a look at Pratap Yadav (@PratapY87065717): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/PratapY87065717?s=09">https://twitter.com/PratapY87065717?s=09</a><br /><br /><br /><br />#education<br />#studywithpratap<br />#PratapTechmunch{% endraw %}
