{% raw %}Jim Croce : Photographs &amp; Memories : Classic Hits (2004)<br /><br />Photographs and memories<br />Christmas cards you sent to me<br />All that I have are these<br />To remember you<br /><br />Memories that come at night<br />Take me to another time<br />Back to a happier day<br />When I called you mine<br /><br />Chorus:<br />But we sure had a good time<br />When we started way back when<br />Morning walks and bedroom talks<br />Oh how I loved you then<br /><br />Summer skies and lullabies<br />Nights we couldn't say good-bye<br />And of all of the things that we knew<br />Not a dream survived<br /><br />Photographs and memories<br />All the love you gave to me<br />Somehow it just can't be true<br />That's all I've left of you<br /><br />(Repeat Chorus){% endraw %}
