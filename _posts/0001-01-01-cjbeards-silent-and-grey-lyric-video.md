{% raw %}Happy new year! Hoping 2021 will be a much better year for many of you compared to 2020, and to kick it off I have a lyric video! I actually made the last song, “Heart of the Wicked”, from this one as a more orchestral version, but it basically turned into its own thing. Really proud of how this one turned out as a blending of cinematic and my dark/electronic sound, hope you all like it, more to come in 2021!<br /><br />▶ Free Download / Stream: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fanlink.to/evpB">https://fanlink.to/evpB</a><br /><br />▶ Instrumental Version Download:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/i9sfp7ru884yfij/Silent.mp3?dl=1">https://www.dropbox.com/s/i9sfp7ru884yfij/Silent.mp3?dl=1</a><br /><br />▶ My Social Media Links:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/cjbeards">https://soundcloud.com/cjbeards</a>    <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCarvKz1XSCON68oeSZ1mlkg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCarvKz1XSCON68oeSZ1mlkg</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Cjbeards">https://twitter.com/Cjbeards</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/cjbeards?fref=ts">https://www.facebook.com/cjbeards?fref=ts</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/cjbeardsofficial/">https://www.instagram.com/cjbeardsofficial/</a><br /><br />▶ Lyrics:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://genius.com/Cjbeards-silent-and-grey-lyrics">https://genius.com/Cjbeards-silent-and-grey-lyrics</a><br /><br />▶ Feel free to use this song in videos, streams, etc, as long as you give me credit :){% endraw %}
