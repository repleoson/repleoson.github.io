{% raw %}Well, I haven't done a real Goku tribute before, so I thought I would. This is not the Full AMV that I've been talking about in past videos, that one is still being worked on. This video was made for fun, you gotta enjoy yourself when you do this stuff after all! I also had a lot of inspiration with this song.<br /><br />Anyways, I could go on and on, but I hope you all enjoy this as much as I did making it!<br /><br />Song: Developments<br />Band: Hands Like Houses<br />Anime: Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z<br /><br />NOTE: I know there are a bitch load of quality switches and... IT WAS ALL 100% ON PURPOSE - Dedicated to all the people who bitch about the quality. :){% endraw %}
