{% raw %}&quot;Murder Weapon&quot; is a reworking of the classic dancehall hit from Jamaican-born Echo Minott, originally released in the early '90s. Tricky fell in love with the track and was determined to hear how it would sound with a female vocalist (in a similar fashion to his reworking of &quot;Black Steel&quot; with Martina Topley-Bird). <br /><br />Tricky here enrolls Irish-Italian Franky Riley, who has toured as Tricky's vocalist for two years and makes her recording debut on his new album &quot;Mixed Race&quot;. <br /><br />Directed by Fleur &amp; Manu.Domino Recording Company is an independent record label founded in 1993.
