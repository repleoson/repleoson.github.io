The song centers on a pure and unbreakable material, &quot;black diamond&quot; and a sword  naturally formed of this material.  We hope you enjoy it:)<br /><br />We wrote the lyrics, composed, and arranged the piece.  My family sang it.<br /><br />Artwork by:<br />Chris Johnson<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebeardedbrushandblade.com">https://www.thebeardedbrushandblade.com</a><br /><br />Song Description:<br /><br />Welcome to the fantasy world of Erna – “Irna” in the dwarven dialect.  This song serves as a fitting introduction to this world, as conceptualized by one of our members, and continuing the genre of dwarven music, much enjoyed by our listeners. <br /><br />The first part speaks of the creation of this world, and is sung by the “Guardians” – a higher form of beings who protect diverse aspects and elements of the world.  The final lines are sung by the Earth Guardian Rilfar, who poetically sings of a special “gift” of Irna, the earth herself.<br /><br />The second part is then sung by the dwarves, whose very nature calls them to dig into the things of the earth, where they discovered pockets of this rare gift – i.e. “black diamond” – an iconically pure material, unaffected by any violence of natural or artificial force, and somehow containing a mysterious inner fire that shines in different colors, and at unpredictable times.  This material is so beyond the nature of other earthen materials, and also so rare, that the dwarves covet it with a special avarice, hording it and seeing it not only as having worth in itself, but also defining their own self-worth.<br /><br />The third part is begun by the Guardians again, who sing of a special sword made of this unformable material – thus formed by Irna herself at the dawn of creation – and named by Rilfar in the dwarven language “Negankerdak” – the “Unforged”.  Since it is unique even among the rarest of things, the dwarves, upon finding it deep in the earth, sing of it as their greatest of all treasures.<br /><br /><br />Please no bad language in the comments.  We want this to be family friendly:)  Thank you!<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />The  Loss of Negankerdak<br /><br />(Turarel)<br />Oh, who can say, for who was there,<br />When all things came into the air?<br />(Orla)<br />And who can know?  Who was around<br />When all was made, and their forms were found?<br />(Tara)<br />When first bright stars sent forth their light,<br />(Aerial)<br />When first ice frost covered the night,<br />(Nergalin)<br />When first the west wind unfurled the seas,<br />(Dinach)<br />When first gleaming fruit adorned the trees,<br />(Turarel)<br />When first nine moons tall mountains crowned,<br />(Treal)<br />And all was silent underground,<br />(Rilfar)<br />Then Irna the earth put forth her gift,<br />A fountain deep in a darksome rift.<br /><br />(Dwarves)<br />Rivulets ran, far beneath the seas,<br />Flowing like vines, far beneath the trees.<br />Formed as it passed, in deep earth (was) cast,<br />Far below ground, in deep chambers vast. <br />How did it catch the starry-bright sky,<br />Miles beneath shining realms on high?<br />Light in its depths, like fire or sun,<br />Through its own heart, living courses run.<br />Iron is soft, and gold is dim,<br />Smooth marble coarse, shining silver thin.<br />Metal must fail, stone beauty lack,<br />Beside the gift, the diamond black.<br />It cannot be shaped, cannot be tamed,<br />Howe’er it is found, so it is framed,<br />Too hard to break, too true to melt,<br />The Humbler thwarts arts of smith and smelt.<br /><br />(Turarel and Orla)<br />Oh, Then was found that single treasure,<br />A Sword unique in shape and measure,<br />(Rilfar)<br />By Irna formed from the diamond black,<br />The Earth-wrought, Unforged, Negankerdak<br />(Nergalin and Treal)<br />Lightcatcher, its appearance stark,<br />(Aerial and Dinach)<br />Unbedecked yet flawless, dark,<br />(Tara)<br />A glow in its depths from blade to hilt,<br />(Turarel &amp; Rilfar)<br />Weapon of kings, for greatness built.<br /><br />(Dwarves)<br />The pride of dwarves, it held a place<br />That set us apart, a favored race,<br />Who else received a gift of such worth?<br />Who else such blessings from the earth?<br /><br />(Dwarves)<br />How, then, a gift that becomes a curse?<br />Blessing from heaven, to hell and worse?<br />Came from Shalda, a demon replete <br />With envy, hatred, and vile deceit.  <br />He stole from us in our delight<br />Negankerdak!  That thief in the night!<br />Wielding no arts but evil and ire, <br />He left our people in darkness dire.  <br />Oh! Negankerdak, when none could break you,<br />What cruel malice could come and take you?<br />Where are you now, in enemy hands, <br />A demon thrall, in what shadow lands?<br />Black Diamond sword, our symbol of light,<br />Without you, see! our days become night!<br />Gift from Irna, of metal most pure,<br />Icon of our race, how shall we endure?{% endraw %}
