{% raw %}Today on Dirt Lifestyle, we are building your first fabrication project! I'm going to go into more detail on this project for those of you that are brand new to metal fabrication.<br />This video is for someone that has been practicing welding and is ready to start their first project. It's likely that your early projects will be bumpers, fenders or sliders. In this video I'm going to build some steel fenders for my car trailer but these basic principles can be carried to just about anything. <br />Don't get discouraged! Fabrication is fun and it doesn't need to look incredible! I just needs to be functional!<br />Thanks for watching ðŸ‘Š<br /><br />AMAZON ITEMS!!!Â Â  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/dirtlifestylenate">https://www.amazon.com/shop/dirtlifestylenate</a><br />(Amazon Affiliate Links)<br />BARNES 4WD COUPON CODE: &quot;dirtlifestyle&quot; 10% off<br />EMPIRE ABRASIVED 10% OFF: &quot;dirtlifestyle&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lddy.no/qf79">https://lddy.no/qf79</a><br />JOOLCA HOT WATER HEATERl:Â  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/37qLgEp">https://bit.ly/37qLgEp</a><br />YANKUM:Â Â  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://yankum.com?afmc=1l">http://yankum.com?afmc=1l</a><br />ONX MAPS:Â Â  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://webmap.onxmaps.com/account-purchase.html?app=offroad&amp;product=offroad_premium_year&amp;fpr=nate12">https://webmap.onxmaps.com/account-purchase.html?app=offroad&amp;product=offroad_premium_year&amp;fpr=nate12</a><br />MIDLAND RADIOS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2IjmlZD">https://bit.ly/2IjmlZD</a><br /><br />*Shirts &amp; Hats on our website!!*<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thedirtlifestyle.com">https://www.thedirtlifestyle.com</a><br /><br />Support us on Patreon!   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/dirtlifestyle">https://www.patreon.com/dirtlifestyle</a><br /><br />Follow me on social media!!<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/dirtlifestylenate/">https://instagram.com/dirtlifestylenate/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/dirtlifestylenate/">https://www.facebook.com/dirtlifestylenate/</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER:<br />Due to factors out of the control of Dirt Lifestyle, we cannot guarantee against improper use or unauthorized modifications of this information.
