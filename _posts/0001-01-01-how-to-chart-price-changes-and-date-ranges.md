{% raw %}The Date Range and Price Range tools are popular and easy to use tools for measuring the price change of any asset. They can measure historical corrections, drawdowns, bull markets, bear markets, target zones, profit zones, and anything else you can think of in trading.<br /><br />You can also use the Date Range tool to measure the distance between two points. The Date Range tool is helpful for studying prior trading activity and planning trades out. How long did the last breakout last? How long did the five most recent corrections last? These are examples of questions you could ask yourself. Then, use the tools available to you to study and chart markets.<br /><br />We hope you enjoy this video and it helps you get started with the Price and Date Range tools. Both tools can be found on the left-side of the chart. <br /><br />Try TradingView: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tradingview.com">https://tradingview.com</a><br />Get up to $30 in TradingView Coins for you and a friend: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tradingview.com/share-your-love/">https://www.tradingview.com/share-your-love/</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/tradingview/">https://twitter.com/tradingview/</a> <br />Follow us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/tradingview">https://www.facebook.com/tradingview</a><br />#TradingView #Charts #Stocks{% endraw %}
