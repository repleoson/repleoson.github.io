{% raw %}Sometimes we're confronted with situations in life that are too big for us to handle. The finances are getting too difficult. The relationship is too damaged. The medical report is too scary. <br /><br />It's in those moments we have a choice to doubt and question the character of God, or choose to simply say... &quot;I believe You're able. I believe You're good. I believe You're with me, even now....&quot; And this choice perhaps may the most difficult of all choices. Therein illuminates the fiber of our faith, and begs the question: Will I continue to trust God in all situations, or just in the comfortable ones? Will I worship in the storm, or just when the waves are cool and calm?<br /><br />My deepest fear as always been that God is secretly malicious, conniving, mad, and out to trick me.... But that's why we wrote this mantra of faith. For those times when you want to give up. No matter what you're going through today, you can trust the compassionate heart of God. He's not safe, but He's good. His character stays the same, even when everything around you is failing. He's is, and always has been, Your PROVIDER.<br /><br />If YOU have a story of God's provision in you life, or a scripture that you hold on to in the storm, please leave it in the comments below!!{% endraw %}
