{% raw %}New World Endgame Resource Guide. When it comes to the end game there are certain crafting professions you want to level like Stonecutting, Arcana and Cooking. Some of these are mandatory to enter dungeons / expeditions. A big reason for this would be tuning orbs, gemstones, high end potions and endgame food buffs. A lot of people leveling up asking what items they should and should not keep! I figured I would take the time to make a video showing you a lot of the good items that you should be holding on to and not sell for gold right now! There are a few key endgame things you should keep in mind as you will get many good materials while leveling up that you will need later! Take these tips and tricks into account so that you do not end up regretting it later!<br /><br />Make sure you are liking, subscribing, and hitting the bell to be notified for more tips and tricks in New World.<br /><br />If you REALLY liked this content join us in Aeternum!
