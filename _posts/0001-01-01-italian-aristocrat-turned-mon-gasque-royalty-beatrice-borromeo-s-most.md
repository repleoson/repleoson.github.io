{% raw %}Beatrice Borromeo married Pierre Casiraghi of Monaco in 2015, she didn’t simply wear one couture dress. Instead, she chose four different gowns, two by Valentino for her civil service in Monaco and two by Armani Privé for the religious service in Lake Maggiore. If this isn’t proof of her sartorial savoir-faire, we’re not sure what is.<br /><br />The 36-year-old European royal is the daughter of Don Carlo Ferdinando, of the Italian aristocratic house Borromeo. Something of a celebrity in her native country, she worked as a political journalist and documentary maker, before marrying Casiraghi, the younger son of Caroline, Princess of Hanover and the grandson of Grace Kelly.<br /><br />Italian Aristocrat Turned Monégasque Royalty Beatrice Borromeo’s Most Stylish Moments To Date #ItalianAristocrat #MonégasqueRoyalty #RoyalFamily<br /><br />Beatrice Borromeo oozes Grace Kelly-esque glamour in head-to-toe Dior at Monaco's National Day <br />We look at the chic, modern style of the Italian aristocrat turned Monégasque royalty, from her four wedding dresses, to her penchant for Valentino, Armani Privé and Chanel to her latest elegant appearance in Dior <br /><br />Beatrice Borromeo in head-to-toe Dior with Princess Alexandra of Hanover and Tatiana Santo Domingo at Monaco's National Day, 2021<br /><br />Beatrice Borromeo and Pierre Casiraghi at the wedding reception of Princess Maria Anunciata of Liechtenstein's wedding in 2021<br /><br />Attend the Red Cross Summer Concert with the Royal Family of Monaco in 2021<br /><br />With Princess Alexandra of Hanover and Pierre Casiraghi at the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco at Circuit de Monaco in 2021<br /><br />With her husband Pierre Casiraghi and two sons Francesco and Stephano Casiraghi at the Monaco National Day celebrations.<br /><br />With her husband Pierre Casiraghi and two sons, Francesco and Stephano Casiraghi at the Monaco National Day celebrations in 2020<br /><br />Arriving at Monaco Cathedral during the Monaco National Day Celebrations in 2019<br /><br />At the Red Cross Ball in Monaco in 2019<br /><br />At the Alberta Ferretti cruise 2020 show<br /><br />At the Monaco Grand Prix in 2019<br /><br />With Pierre Casiraghi at Monaco National Day in 2017<br /><br />With Pierre Casiraghi at the Venice Film Festival in 2017<br /><br />With Pierre Casiraghi at the Copa del Rey Mapfre Sailing Cup in 2017<br /><br />With Pierre Casiraghi in Monaco in 2017<br /><br />At the wedding of Prince Ernst August of Hanover in 2017<br /><br />With Pierre Casiraghi at the Rose Ball in 2017<br /><br />With Pierre Casiraghi at the Monaco National Day in 2016<br /><br />At the Copa del Rey Mapfre Sailing Cup in 2016<br /><br />At the wedding of Prince Franz Albrecht zu Oettingen-Spielberg and Cleopatra von Adelsheim in 2016<br /><br />With Pierre Casiraghi at the Milan Convivio Fair in 2016<br /><br />Arriving at her wedding to Pierre Casiraghi in 2015<br /><br />With Pierre Casiraghi at the Rose Ball in aid of Princess Grace in 2015<br /><br />With Pierre Casiraghi at the Monaco Yacht Club opening in 2014<br /><br />With Pierre Casiraghi at the Rose Ball in aid of Princess Grace in 2014<br /><br />At the Giorgio Armani Prive show at Paris Couture Week Spring/Summer 2014<br /><br />With Pierre Casiraghi at the wedding of Prince Felix of Luxembourg and Claire Lademacher at Basilique Sainte Marie-Madeleine in 2013<br /><br />With her sisterinlaw Charlotte Casiraghi at La Dolce Vita world restoration premiere at the Rome Film Festival in 2010<br /><br />With her sister-in-law Charlotte Casiraghi at La Dolce Vita world restoration premiere at the Rome Film Festival in 2010<br /><br />With Pierre Casiraghi at the Convivio held at Fiera Milano City in 2010<br /><br />At the Monaco Grand Prix Gala dinner in 2010<br /><br />Music Credits: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np-Y8ClGgRk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np-Y8ClGgRk</a><br />Song: Jim Yosef &amp;
