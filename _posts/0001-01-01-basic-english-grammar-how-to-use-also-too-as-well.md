{% raw %}What is the difference between “also”, “too”, and “as well”? You may think that they can be used at any time, but there are actually a few differences. In this English grammar lesson, we will look at those differences. First, I will teach you the meaning of each of these words and their function in a sentence. Hint: two of them are adverbs, and the other is a phrase. Then, I will show you how they are normally used, as well as some special cases. It’s important to know how to use these words in order to avoid sounding too repetitive. If you always use “too”, you can change it up and use “also” or “as well”, but you need to know how to use them correctly. So watch the lesson, and then do the quiz to practice what you’ve learned! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.engvid.com/basic-english-grammar-also-too-as-well/">https://www.engvid.com/basic-english-grammar-also-too-as-well/</a><br /><br />Watch next:<br />English Grammar: AT, ON, IN <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/sN5H7YTo_IQ">https://youtu.be/sN5H7YTo_IQ</a><br />Basic English Grammar: Parts of Speech <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/SceDmiBEESI">https://youtu.be/SceDmiBEESI</a>{% endraw %}
