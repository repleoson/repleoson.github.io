{% raw %}The FDA New Era of Smarter Food Safety Summit on E-Commerce: Ensuring the Safety of Foods Ordered Online and Delivered Directly to Consumers will take place virtually October 19-21, 2021. The summit is designed to help the agency improve its understanding of how human and animal foods are sold through Business to Consumer e-commerce models across the U.S. and globally. It is an opportunity for FDA to further our collaboration on food safety with our federal, state, local, and tribal regulatory partners, and a broad array of stakeholders, including industry, consumers, consumer and public health organizations, and academia. The FDA intends to use what we learn during the public meeting, and from comments submitted to the Federal Register, to help determine what actions, if any, may be needed to keep consumers safe.<br /><br />Submit Written Comments - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/09/07/2021-19219/food-and-drug-administration-new-era-of-smarter-food-safety-summit-on-e-commerce-public-meeting">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/09/07/2021-19219/food-and-drug-administration-new-era-of-smarter-food-safety-summit-on-e-commerce-public-meeting</a><br /><br />#SmarterFoodSafety{% endraw %}
