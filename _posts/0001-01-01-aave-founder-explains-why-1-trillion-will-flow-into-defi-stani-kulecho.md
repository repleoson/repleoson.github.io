{% raw %}In this episode of Empire, Jason is joined by Aave founder/CEO Stani Kulechov &amp; technology investor Santiago R Santos. Sitting at the forefront of the fast evolving DeFi ecosystem, we invited Stani &amp; Santiago on to Empire to share their thoughts on the exponential growth and assess whether DeFi has hit escape velocity. <br /><br />This conversation was fascinating and covered a range of topics including how DeFi managed to attract $100 Billion of total value during the 2020 DeFi summer, when $1 trillion of value will be locked in DeFi, how social media could be decentralised in the web 3.0 transition, NFT's, Stani &amp; Santiago's outlook for the end of year bull market &amp; so much more.<br /><br />Avalanche:<br />Thank you to Avalanche for sponsoring Empire.
