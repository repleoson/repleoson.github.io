{% raw %}Read-aloud of the children’s story by Eric Carle, read by Lisa Nazim<br /><br />Fair Use of Copyrighted Written Works, for Educational Purposes<br /><br />As a retired Early Childhood Educator, I have made this read-aloud video of a selected work of high quality children’s literature for 3 reasons. <br />1) To communicate my love of literature with my grandchildren, whom I cannot visit, due to the pandemic. <br />2) To provide a literary resource to Early Childhood teachers who seek online examples of good stories for their e-learning students. Teachers would normally read this book in class, with the children gathered on the carpet, but they cannot, due to school closures. If they use this story, they will likely add their own follow-up provisions, such as art or writing activities, or discussion in a Zoom meeting. <br />3) To provide an example of British English, Received Pronunciation, to children who are learners of English as an additional language (EAL). <br />This read-aloud does not aim to harm the core market for the original book, which I highly recommend you buy, and this video is not monetised. <br /><br />For information on Fair Use of Copyrighted Material for educational purposes, see <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2020-03-30-can-teachers-read-books-out-loud-online-actually-yes">https://www.edsurge.com/news/2020-03-30-can-teachers-read-books-out-loud-online-actually-yes</a>{% endraw %}
