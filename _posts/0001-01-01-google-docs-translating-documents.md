{% raw %}We're going to show you how to quickly and automatically translate an entire document. Google Docs lets you choose from over 100 languages to translate to or from. While the translations aren't always perfect, they're often good enough to get the message across. <br /><br /><br /><br />When translating, the original document will remain unchanged. Google Docs will create a copy of the doc and automatically translate it to the language you have chosen.<br /><br /><br />We hope you enjoy!
