It is believed that it was first recorded by the King in 1513, shortly after his coronation. It is generally believed that Henry wrote the song for Catherine of Aragon. <br /><br />The song was very popular across renaissance Europe. Although technically simple, the catchy melody of the song was greatly enjoyed by monarchs in Britain and on the continent. Some accounts claim that the song was a favorite of Queen Elizabeth I, daughter of Henry VIII. <br /><br />The song itself reflects the exuberant life-style of the English nobility at the time. Supported by economic stability at home, Henry's court was famous for its wealth. The lyrics describe Henry's love for this lifestyle of play and excess. <br /><br /><br />Lyrics (English):<br /><br />Pastime with good company<br />I love and shall unto I die;<br />Grudge who list, but none deny, <br />So God be pleased thus live will I. <br />      For my pastance<br />      Hunt, song, and dance.<br />            My heart is set:<br />      All goodly sport<br />      For my comfort,<br />            Who shall me let? <br /><br />Youth must have some dalliance, <br />Of good or ill√© some pastance;<br />Company methinks then best<br />All thoughts and fancies to dejest:<br />      For idleness<br />      Is chief mistress<br />            Of vices all. <br />      Then who can say<br />      But mirth and play<br />            Is best of all? <br /><br />Company with honesty<br />Is virtue vices to flee:<br />Company is good and ill<br />But every man hath his free will.<br />      The best ensue, <br />      The worst eschew, <br />            My mind shall be:<br />      Virtue to use, <br />      Vice to refuse, <br />            Shall I use me.{% endraw %}
