{% raw %}Please visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.TapWithBrad.com">http://www.TapWithBrad.com</a><br /><br />If you are new to tapping, please watch this video so you understand what it is about: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiD72cZ5mcU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiD72cZ5mcU</a><br /><br />So that I can make these videos available, I need to state that you must take responsibility for your own well-being if you choose to tap along.  While I'm confident that tapping along with this video can provide great benefits, I make no claims as to what, if any, benefits you will receive. While EFT has yielded impressive results in treating physical and psychological issues, not everyone will benefit in the same way. I am not a doctor, and the information presented here is not intended to replace appropriate treatment by a physician or mental health professional.  EFT is still in the experimental stage and, while a growing number of PhD's and MD's are adopting it, we cannot claim that it is risk free.   I am unaware of anyone experiencing negative side effects from using these videos, but different people require different care, and depending on a number of variables, it is possible you could uncover deeper issues within the process that this video is not able to address.  It is recommended that you consult a qualified health practitioner prior to using this technique.<br /><br />That being said, I hope you will enjoy this video and find it beneficial, and that you will share it with others. <br /><br />This is certainly not intended to be a comprehensive handling of the subject -- I can only cover so much in 5-10 minutes...!  I'm also not working with you  personally to address specific individual issues. Hopefully, though, it will help you address the issue enough that you can experience greater freedom to live the life you really desire and deserve.  For further support, I encourage you to check out the other offerings available from myself and other EFT practitioners, including workshops and private sessions.  For more information about tapping, as well as a ton of great resources to help you live your best life possible, please visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.bradyates.net">http://www.bradyates.net</a><br /><br />This is only my way of using the process, rather than what might be called official EFT.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this video, please subscribe to my videos and share them with others.
