(Me, me, me, me)<br />Do you wipe them just for me? (Me, me, me, me)<br />I'm pleading on my knees (Knees, knees, knees, knees)<br />It's your touch that I need (Need, need, need, need)<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />I followed you today, I was in my car<br />I wanted to come and see you from afar<br />If you turned around and saw me I would die<br />I pretend I was a person driving by<br />Wrote you a song, do you wanna hear it now?<br />Don't bring your friends around to form a crowd<br />'Cause I need to prove I wrote it just for you<br />What's the need for them when it could be just us two? (Two, two, two, two)<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />I'm obsessed with you in a way I can't believe<br />When you wipe your tears, do you wipe them just for me? (Me, me, me, me)<br />Do you wipe them just for me? (Me, me, me, me)<br />I'm pleading on my knees (Knees, knees, knees, knees)<br />It's your touch that I need (Need, need, need, need)<br />[Outro]<br />(Just for you)<br /><br />when you wipe your tears do you wipe them just for me, when you wipe your tears do you wipe them just for me tiktok, when you wipe your tears do you wipe them just for me tiktok song, tiktok, tik tok, tiktok song, tiktok compilation, pinkpantheress just for me, pinkpantheress just for me tiktok, pinkpantheress just for me tiktok song, wipe your tears, wipe your tears tiktok, wipe your tears tiktok song, just for me wipe your tears, just for me wipe your tears tiktok, just for me wipe your tears tiktok compilation<br /><br />#pinkpantheress #JustForMe #Lyrics<br />âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–âž–<br /><br />For business inquiries and other issues please contact: cloudxmusic.contact@gmail.com<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------{% endraw %}
