{% raw %}-- PWITS  --<br />(Released September 2016)<br /><br />Young people from across three boroughs of  London came together to produce an educational resource that challenges misconceptions and explodes myths surrounding ‘victimless’ crimes. The Trap was the result. Two powerful films that explore the impact of street drug dealing and knife carrying on individuals and their communities. Their message is loud and clear: There is no such thing as a victimless crime. Everyone gets hurt in the process.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thetrapuk.com/#Aboutus">http://thetrapuk.com/#Aboutus</a><br /><br />© 2016 The Trap.
