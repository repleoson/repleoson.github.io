Mother Hen leads the children to sing the days of the week in various styles - quiet, loud, and fast. <br /><br />As the song starts, Mr. Crabby greets the children and asks them to listen to Mother Hen sing the first verse. When the second verse starts, Bear, Cat, Pig, and Dog appear to sing along. Mr. Crabby encourages the audience to repeat after Mother Hen.<br />The third and fourth verse is sung quietly and loud. Last but not least, Bear, Cat, Pig and Dog appear with their instruments, and the whole song is sung really fast!<br /><br />Enjoy this song in the classroom or at home with your kids! They will have memorized the days of the week in no time!<br /><br />If you like this video, don't forget to click the LIKE button :)<br /><br />Buy &amp; Download this Song (mp3):<br />iTunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/artist/the-singing-walrus/id992755520">https://itunes.apple.com/ca/artist/the-singing-walrus/id992755520</a><br />Google Play: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/music/artist/The_Singing_Walrus?id=Acadfghn7zw3q5i2c6bfr3gmcnu&amp;hl=en">https://play.google.com/store/music/artist/The_Singing_Walrus?id=Acadfghn7zw3q5i2c6bfr3gmcnu&amp;hl=en</a><br /><br />Buy &amp; Download this video (mp4):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sellfy.com/thesingingwalrus">https://sellfy.com/thesingingwalrus</a><br /><br />The Singing Walrus creates fun teaching materials, such as kids songs, educational games, nursery rhymes, and kindergarten worksheets (e.g. handwriting worksheets) for parents and teachers.
