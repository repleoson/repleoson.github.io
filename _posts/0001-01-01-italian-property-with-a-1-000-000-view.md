{% raw %}Want to buy an Italian property with a $1,000,000 view? Outstanding Real Estate in Italy. Come with me on my one take Italian property virtual tour. <br /><br />This amazing Italian property has been in the same ownership for the last 50 years. In my opinion it has a million dollar view of the surrounding Italian countryside looking towards Todi in Umbria and the Apennine mountains beyond. <br /><br />I see lots of Italian houses almost every day for sale or to rent and I always get excited when I see such potential in an old Italian property which hasn't been too modernised over the years and still retains a lot of its original features. Also, for those of you who want a view you will be hard pushed to find a big sky and far reaching view then this. <br /><br />The main house may need some updating depending on your taste and requirements. Please note presently there is no central heating, just wood burners. Recently the owners has installed new double glazed windows and an aircon system for the principle bedroom. <br /><br />These buildings rarely come to the market. There's plenty of room for improvement. If you're looking for that special place, Italian dream home, with the wow factor, and you would like to add your personal style or appoint your favourite interior designer to create it for you, then this piece of Italian real estate should be right up your street. <br /><br />Main features<br /><br />Magnificent view of Todi and beyond.<br />17th century building measuring just under 400 square metres<br />15m x 7m swimming pool<br />6500 square metres of land<br />2 annexes to restore (a barn and a pigsty)<br /><br />Todi - 13 kms, Perugia airport - 50 kms, Florence in 90 minutes and Rome in 2hrs.<br /><br />Energy class G - 307.70 kWh/m2<br /><br />Link to the property description: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.abodeitaly.com/property/573/it/umbria/todi/vista-todi/house/5-bedrooms">https://www.abodeitaly.com/property/573/it/umbria/todi/vista-todi/house/5-bedrooms</a><br /><br />Go to our YouTube channel and see our latest amazing one take Italian Property Virtual Tours.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/italianproperty">https://www.youtube.com/italianproperty</a><br /><br />To see our website with hundreds of amazing Italian propeties please go to:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.abodeitaly.com">https://www.abodeitaly.com</a><br /><br />Need to reach out?<br /><br />Email us info@abodeitaly.com.
