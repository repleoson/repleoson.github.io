As frequent cruisers on Royal Caribbean ships, we have sailed on numerous vessels and know exactly what is complimentary and what is not included in the price. To help those first-time cruisers with the brand, we have put together our latest video of what is included on Royal Caribbean AND what will cost you extra. <br /><br />If you enjoy the video, please make sure to give it a BIG THUMBS UP! <br /><br />What's Included on Royal Caribbean Cruise Line<br />0:00 Introduction<br />0:35 Accommodations<br />1:15 Food Part of a Royal Caribbean Cruise Fare<br />4:20 Onboard Activities<br />6:05 Royal Caribbean Entertainment<br />7:30 Youth Programs on Royal Caribbean Ships<br />8:20 What is Not Part of Royal Caribbean International Cruises <br /><br /><br />Your Royal Caribbean cruise fare includes your accommodations for the duration of the cruise. A stateroom attendant will make up your room twice daily. Your Royal Caribbean  cruise also includes meals throughout the day at several restaurants. All ships will have the Windjammer which is open most of the day serving a buffet of hot and cold items. Most ships also have a casual sandwich shop or café that is open most of the day. There is also the main dining room that has nightly dinner with a rotational menu for no additional fee.<br /><br />There are plenty of entertainment options and onboard activities that are part of the cruise fare on Royal Caribbean ships. Activities such as dance classes, trivia, pool side games and contests, and other talks and seminars are free during your cruise. Many ships feature additional activities like laser tag, waterslides, surf simulators, and other family-friendly amenities that are all part of the cruise fare. <br /><br />Most evenings in the main theater, there will be entertainment which will not cost you a dime. Headliner acts, Broadway hits like Hairspray, Grease, or Mamma Mia, and other signature productions are all included in the cost of your cruise. For some of these shows, you do need to make reservations. <br /><br />While there is certainly plenty of included amenities and activities, not everything on the ship is included during your voyage. On Royal Caribbean cruise ships, alcoholic beverages, bottled water, and specialty coffee are not included. There are drink packages to purchase if you opt to include these beverages as be part of your vacation. Many ships also have up-charge amenities, such as escape rooms, as well as specialty classes and demonstrations that are extra. We don't recommend these on a Royal Caribbean International cruise. <br /><br />Royal Caribbean cruise also has several specialty restaurants that have an additional charge. Popular venues like Chops Grille, Izumi Sushi, or Hooked Seafood serve dinner nightly. If you choose to dine here, you can pay the cover charge (or a la carte pricing depending on the venue). These are some of our favorite Royal Caribbean International Venues! <br /><br />Other additions on Royal Caribbean cruise ships include daily gratuities, as well as any onboard shopping or gaming in the casino.  These are some of the Royal Caribbean International venues we avoid on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship. <br /><br />Read everything that is included (and extra) on Royal Caribbean cruise back on the blog: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://eatsleepcruise.com/2020/03/whats-included-on-a-royal-caribbean-cruise/">https://eatsleepcruise.com/2020/03/whats-included-on-a-royal-caribbean-cruise/</a><br />Is the Royal Caribbean Cruise International Drink Package Worth it? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/oBYJW09yn64">https://youtu.be/oBYJW09yn64</a><br />What it is Really Like on Royal Caribbean Cruise Perfect Day at CocoCay! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/WuQUXmVP6Js">https://youtu.be/WuQUXmVP6Js</a><br />Top 10 New Cruise Ships of 2020 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/2ULGCSadPac">https://youtu.be/2ULGCSadPac</a><br />Featuring a Royal Caribbean cruise ship, Odyssey of the Seas<br />Royal Caribbean Odyssey of the Seas Ship Details: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/-NSQVj0U1T4">https://youtu.be/-NSQVj0U1T4</a><br /><br />Make sure to SUBSCRIBE to our channel above to get the latest cruise tips, cruise reviews, packing guides, port guides, travel tips, and more. <br /><br />Join us on Social Media as we “Sea the World, One Port at a Time.” <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/EatSleepCruise">https://instagram.com/EatSleepCruise</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/EatSleepCruise">https://facebook.com/EatSleepCruise</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EatSleepCruise">https://twitter.com/EatSleepCruise</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pinterest.com/EatSleepCruise">https://pinterest.com/EatSleepCruise</a> <br /><br />Some promotional photos and video courtesy of Royal Caribbean  <br /><br />Royalty Free Music Courtesy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com">https://www.epidemicsound.com</a><br /><br />#RoyalCaribbean #RoyalCaribbeanCruise #RoyalCaribbeanInternational{% endraw %}
