{% raw %}Brilliant outdoor ideas for adventure lovers<br /><br />If you can't imagine yourself staying at home every weekend and would rather be lost somewhere in a wild forest, then these camping life hacks are for you! Our collection of smart travel tips and road ideas will definitely help you solve any problem while you're away from home on another adventure.<br /><br />You don't need to buy a boat if you need one. Instead, try out our recycling DIY ideas - making a boat yourself by reusing a big old plastic bottle. Take a bottle of a size where you can comfortably sit in and cut a hole in it. Attach pool noodles as a safe edging around the cut and fix some wooden planks. They will help you balance the weight in a boat. Take a paddle and you're ready for a new river or lake adventure! Be sure to always wear a life west for safety during your trip ðŸ›¶<br /><br />You may not take a bucket on your trips, but always take an adhesive tape, because you can DIY almost anything with it, for example, a bucket. Fins a big tree branch and place a plastic bag on it. Now tape it all around with an adhesive tape creating the shape of the bag. The tape bucket is more durable than a plastic bag, you can use it for carrying water or any other goods.<br /><br />Timestamps:<br />0:00 Fast coffe-making trick<br />0:35 DIY boat<br />2:27 Great outdoor car transformation<br />5:10 DIY bucket<br />5:50 Life vest from plastic bottles<br />9:00 How to make popcorn in a tin can<br />11:59 Wildlife survival hacks for girls<br />15:49 DIY outdoor toilet<br />17:48 Easy-to-make no sew backpack idea<br />19:30 Delicious baked apples with caramel<br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
