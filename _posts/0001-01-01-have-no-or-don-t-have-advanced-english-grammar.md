{% raw %}In this video, learn the difference between &quot;Don't Have&quot; and &quot;Have No&quot;. <br /><br />Both of these structures are possible to form negative sentences. Native speakers commonly use &quot;Have No&quot;, but we do it in a very specific situation. This is because &quot;don't have&quot; is the standard way to form a negative sentence, and &quot;have no&quot; is an alternative that is only used in specific cases. <br /><br />Improve your advanced English grammar with this video by learning the difference between &quot;have no&quot; and &quot;don't have&quot;. <br /><br />Please subscribe for more videos to help you learn English and sound like a native English speaker!  <br /><br /><br /><br />Let’s Connect: <br /><br /><br /><br />Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/JForrestEnglish">https://www.facebook.com/JForrestEnglish</a> <br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JForrestEnglish">https://twitter.com/JForrestEnglish</a><br /><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-forrest">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-forrest</a><br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.jforrestenglish.com/">http://www.jforrestenglish.com/</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />Free Guide – Speak English Fluently &amp; Confidently in 6 Easy Steps.
