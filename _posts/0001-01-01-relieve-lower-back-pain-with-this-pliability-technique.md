{% raw %}If you sit at a desk all day, chances are you've dealt with your fair share of lower back tightness and pain. Without proper posture, long hours of sedentary behavior like this can cause a number of back-related aches and pains to pop up and linger. We like to target the lower back with a TB12™ Vibrating Pliability Roller in order to help relieve tightness and pain and enhance pliability in the area.  <br /><br />Pliability work primes your muscles to absorb and disperse forces so you can perform better and recover faster. Pliability work turns short, dense muscles into long, soft, and resilient muscles capable of 100 percent muscle pump function.<br /><br /><br /><br />Shop » <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tb12sports.com/shop">https://tb12sports.com/shop</a><br />Twitter » <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/tb12sports">https://twitter.com/tb12sports</a> <br />Instagram » <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tb12sports/">https://www.instagram.com/tb12sports/</a> <br />Facebook » <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TB12sports/">https://www.facebook.com/TB12sports/</a>{% endraw %}
