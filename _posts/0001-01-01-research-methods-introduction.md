{% raw %}In this video, Dr Greg Martin provides an introduction to research methods, methedology  and study design. Specifically he takes a look at qualitative and quantitative research methods including case control studies, cohort studies, observational research etc. <br /><br />Global health (and public health) is truly multidisciplinary and leans on epidemiology, health economics, health policy, statistics, ethics, demography.... the list goes on and on. This YouTube channel is here to provide you with some teaching and information on these topics. I've also posted some videos on how to find work in the global health space and how to raise money or get a grant for your projects. <br /><br />Please feel free to leave comments and questions - I'll respond to all of them (we'll, I'll try to at least). Feel free to make suggestions as to future content for the channel. <br /><br />SUPPORT: <br />—————-<br />This channel has a crowd-funding campaign (please support if you find these videos useful). <br /><br />Here is the link:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/GH_support">http://bit.ly/GH_support</a><br /><br /><br /><br />OTHER USEFUL LINKS:<br />————————<br /><br />Channel page:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/GH_channel">http://bit.ly/GH_channel</a><br /> <br />Subscribe:         <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/GH_subscribe">http://bit.ly/GH_subscribe</a><br /><br />Google+:           <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/GH_Google">http://bit.ly/GH_Google</a><br /><br />Twitter:              @drgregmartin <br /><br />Facebook:         <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/GH_facebook">http://bit.ly/GH_facebook</a><br /><br /><br /><br />HERE ARE SOME PLAYLISTS <br />——————————————-<br /><br />Finding work in Global Health:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/GH_working">http://bit.ly/GH_working</a><br /><br />Epidemiology: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/GH_epi">http://bit.ly/GH_epi</a><br /><br />Global Health Ethics: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/GH_ethics">http://bit.ly/GH_ethics</a><br /><br />Global Health Facts:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/GH_facts">http://bit.ly/GH_facts</a><br /><br /><br />WANT CAREER ADVICE? <br />————————————<br />You can book time with Dr Greg Martin via Google Helpouts to get advice about finding work in the global health space. <br /><br />Here is the link:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/GH_career">http://bit.ly/GH_career</a><br /><br />-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-<br />Please watch: &quot;Know how interpret an epidemic curve?&quot; <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SM4PN7Yg1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SM4PN7Yg1s</a><br />-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-{% endraw %}
