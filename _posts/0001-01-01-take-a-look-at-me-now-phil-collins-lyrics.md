{% raw %}I want to remember ...<br />before I become dream,<br />before the wind scatters my memories<br />That I lived a love ...<br />with you,<br />the kind of which â€¦<br />God will ask me ...<br />that I stole the paradise,<br />from His hands...<br /><br />Lyrics :<br /><br />How can I just let you walk away<br />Just let you leave without a trace?<br />When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh ooh<br />You're the only one who really knew me at all<br />How can you just walk away from me<br />When all I can do is watch you leave?<br />'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain<br />And even shared the tears<br />You're the only one who really knew me at all<br />So take a look at me now<br />Well there's just an empty space<br />And there's nothing left here to remind me<br />Just the memory of your face<br />Ooh, take a look at me now<br />Well there's just an empty space<br />And you coming back to me is against the odds<br />And that's what I've got to face<br />I wish I could just make you turn around<br />Turn around and see me cry<br />There's so much I need to say to you<br />So many reasons why<br />You're the only one who really knew me at all<br />So take a look at me now<br />Well there's just an empty space<br />And there's nothing left here to remind me<br />Just the memory of your face<br />Now Take a look at me now<br />'Cause that's just an empty space<br />But to wait for you is all I can do<br />And that's what I've got to face<br />Take a good look at me now<br />'Cause I'll still be standing here<br />And you coming back to me is against all odds<br />It's the chance I've got to take<br />Take a look at me now<br /><br />Disclaimer : No copyright infringement intended. <br />The audio content doesn't belong to me I don't make profit out of this video, I do not own copyright of the video/photos, they are from the web. <br />This is purely for entertainment.{% endraw %}
