{% raw %}Excerpt from 'Targets', 1968 (direction by Peter Bogdanovich).<br /><br />In this powerful scene, one of the main characters, played by Tim O'Kelly, goes up on a remote place, meticulously arrays his selection of guns, has a Coke and a sandwich, as if he was on a casual hunting trip, and prepares himself for shooting; unfortunately, his victims are going to be drivers on the highway.{% endraw %}
