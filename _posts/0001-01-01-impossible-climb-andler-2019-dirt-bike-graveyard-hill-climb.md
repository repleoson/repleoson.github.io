{% raw %}Impossible Climb Andler 2019 was held for the 20th time. Participation was fairly poor compared with previous editions but riders were all bold enough to put a great show. As usual, officially no one made it to the top of the hill but we saw a Suzuki rider managed to pass the finish line with his front wheel. This event is continuing to be a dirt bike graveyard and we love it, enjoy the video!<br /><br />Don't forget Subscribe, Comment and Like.<br /><br />✦ Subscribe for MORE:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2RfrRzC">http://bit.ly/2RfrRzC</a><br />✦ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2RFANxH">http://bit.ly/2RFANxH</a><br />✦ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2lZatjS">http://bit.ly/2lZatjS</a><br />✦ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2TGoTkG">http://bit.ly/2TGoTkG</a><br /><br />#hillclimb #impossibleclimb #dirtbike{% endraw %}
