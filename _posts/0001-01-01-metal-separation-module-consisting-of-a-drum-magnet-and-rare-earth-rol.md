{% raw %}A low-intensity Drum Magnet and high-intensity Rare Earth Roll Magnetic Separator separating strong (including mild steel) and weakly magnetic metals (such as fragmented stainless-steel) from a fines fraction extracted as waste after shredding.  The non-magnetic metals are further processed on an ElectroStatic Separator.<br /><br />A comprehensive description of the process and technology is available on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mastermagnets.com/electrostatically-recovering-copper-wire/">https://www.mastermagnets.com/electrostatically-recovering-copper-wire/</a>{% endraw %}
