He works for a boss who focuses on the negative and chooses to point out team member weaknesses and not strengths. Sinek finds the experience demotivating and over time learns that the opposite approach - treating people with respect, showing empathy, focusing on strengths, and pairing people with complementary skills - is a better way to manage teams. Simon Sinek teaches leaders and organizations how to inspire people. Sinek is the author of two books, &quot;Leaders Eat Last: Why Some Teams Come Together and Others Don't&quot; and &quot;Start With Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action&quot;.
