Dougie Critchley, a neutral mediator, is joined today by two Arsenal fans, Patrick van Straaten and the lesser-spotted George Wright. They talk all things Gunners. Was their start to the season really that bad? At what point does sacking Mikel Arteta make the most sense? They talk about what they don't like about the club, then what they do, giving a lot of airtime to the 'Hale End Kids' - Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe to you and me. They discuss future transfer plans and the need to replace Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, and how their transfers this summer have been good. Then someone mentions Granit Xhaka and the show goes off the rails; the Swiss international is a divisive character for sure. But somehow, this is actually a broadly positive podcast about Arsenal for a change. Is the future really that bright in North London?{% endraw %}
