Sign up here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/libra-new-moon-2021">https://www.crowdcast.io/e/libra-new-moon-2021</a><br />We are coming up to a Libra New Moon, with a stellium of planets lining up in the sign of Justice. This New Moon, happening in just a couple of days, takes place at 13 degrees Libra. The Sun and the Moon will not be far from Mars and Mercury, a potent and powerful combination. It’s time to get serious about the changes we know must come, namely Truth and Justice.<br /><br />Mars is close to the Sun and Moon in Libra, and opposite of Chiron in Aries. This is a transit of empowerment as we as humans collectively rise to the challenge of the times. <br /><br />Venus is at the deeply emotional, end degrees of Scorpio. There’s powerful Astrology next weekend, as we come out of this New Moon with the Stellium of planets in Libra. Venus moves over into Sagittarius on the 7th, and come up to the South Node of the Moon. The Moon joins this potent combo of destiny on Saturday. It’s time for the divine feminine to rise back into her Truth. The Queen returned to her throne. <br /><br />On the same day, 10/10, is when Mars, Mercury and the Sun are closest. Everyone is coming together for a New World, it can only be one based on Peace and Justice. It’s a council inviting in the new renaissance that will carry us over into the New Age. The Kings and intelligent warriors are in council, while Venus rises like the pheonix into her greater destiny. <br /><br />It’s epic messages, reminding us we are living in epic times. Hold on to your hat and keep breathing. The Storm has come.{% endraw %}
