{% raw %}James Corden welcomes Tiffany Haddish to Stage 56 fresh off her GRAMMY win, getting her halfway to an EGOT (and she's got plans for the Tony). After, James asks Tiffany about a very clever technique she used to get immediate feedback from auditions and she tells James about what she learned when she went vegan for a month. And the &quot;Kids Say The Darndest Things&quot; hosts talks about working with Billy Crystal in their film &quot;Here Today.&quot; The premiere episode of &quot;Kids Say The Darndest Things&quot; premieres May 5 on CBS.<br /><br />More Late Late Show:<br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/CordenYouTube">http://bit.ly/CordenYouTube</a><br />Watch Full Episodes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1ENyPw4">http://bit.ly/1ENyPw4</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://on.fb.me/19PIHLC">http://on.fb.me/19PIHLC</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1Iv0q6k">http://bit.ly/1Iv0q6k</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/latelategram">http://bit.ly/latelategram</a><br /><br />Watch The Late Late Show with James Corden weeknights at 12:35 AM ET/11:35 PM CT.

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.&quot;{% endraw %}
