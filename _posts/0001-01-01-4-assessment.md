{% raw %}This audio-visual resource was developed at the request of NHS nurse educators tasked with supporting and integrating newly appointed international nurse recruits. It is intended to support the transition and integration of these nurses into UK practice, focusing on the demonstration of core competences at the point of registration.<br /><br />This resource aims to support an extremely complex and resource intensive process by providing a revision aid to be used by both nurses and their trainers; providing opportunities for review, discussion and debate in groups or as a revision aid for individuals<br /><br />It also aims to familiarise nurses to UK clinical environments and to offer some insights and orientation to simulation based clinical scenarios which might be used as part of assessment of competence.<br /><br />It is not intended to be a definitive guide to undertaking the NMC Part 2 test of competence (UK based OSCE); but does offers hints, tips, signposts and references that may as a consequence, be beneficial in preparing for the OSCE exam. <br /><br />The content is based on the Royal Marsden Manual of Clinical Nursing Procedures (9th Edition) and the European Resuscitation Council Guidelines (2015)<br /><br />The intention is that users will be able to download these resources and use them flexibly.<br /><br />We hope you have found the videos helpful.  We would be grateful if you could take a few minutes to rate your experience of the materials and the ease of access.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://healtheducationyh.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/supporting-transition-into-uk-nursing-practice">https://healtheducationyh.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/supporting-transition-into-uk-nursing-practice</a><br /><br />For more information, contact ghe@hee.nhs.uk<br /><br /><br />Connect with us:<br /><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/nhshee/">https://www.facebook.com/nhshee/</a> <br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/nhs_healthedeng">https://twitter.com/nhs_healthedeng</a><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/nhshee/">https://www.instagram.com/nhshee/</a>{% endraw %}
