Quiet. Calm. It’s a Nightmare. Nothing’s right. It’s all wrong.<br />Fog blankets the streets, just like your sheets that numbingly put you to sleep.<br />Chimneys poke through trees that have lost all their leaves due to cold winter freeze.<br />You give a blank stare into that deep sea, recite your prayer, then fall asleep in this nightmare.<br /><br />A slave to the mundane. Doors locked from the inside.<br />This lazy lullaby makes one day bleed into the next.<br /><br />Candlelight flickers on your grandfather clock face. The secondhand ticks down your days.<br />Tick tock. Your wristwatch won't stop. These years pass by in a blaze.<br /><br />Lone Tree Cemetery lies across the street. Wise is he who ventures these forbidden things.<br />In that dirt lie beggars and kings. An odd figure holds a lantern. Shines it into mysteries.<br />The Ghost of Yet to Come shows you a hurting world…just like today, nothing’s changed.<br />The flame shines on a stone with your name, two dates, and the phrase “Here Lies A Waster of Days.”<br /><br />Don’t carry such a terrible thing into eternity.<br />The wind bids you through open window out onto the sea. You can handle so much more than you think.<br />The breeze fills the sail and the soul, taking you to adventures yet told.<br /><br />The whisper of wisdom dances with your curtains. “Run away with me.”<br />Never despise the days of small beginnings.  She whispers, “Godspeed.”<br /><br />The thunder. The waves. A compass. A stowaway.<br />Give thanks for clear sky and the tempest. Calm seas never shaped the greatest.<br />Leave that town behind. Change your fate.<br />The flame shines on a stone with your name, two dates, and the phrase “Here Lies A Chaser of Waves.“<br />----<br />Follow Worthwhile on Twitter: @WorthwhileBand<br />Like Worthwhile on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/WorthwhileBand">https://www.facebook.com/WorthwhileBand</a><br />Follow Worthwhile on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/worthwhileband">http://instagram.com/worthwhileband</a><br /><br />Subscribe for more great videos from Hopeless Records: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://hopel.es/HRYouTube">http://hopel.es/HRYouTube</a><br /><br />Follow Hopeless Records on Twitter: @HopelessRecords<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://worthwhileband.com">http://worthwhileband.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.hopelessrecords.com">http://www.hopelessrecords.com</a>{% endraw %}
