{% raw %}Whatâ€™s the value -- to your job, your success, your self-image -- of just one intensely-focused session where you filter out distractions and produce more work in two hours than you typically do in a day? Now, what if you multiplied that value over the course of a month, a year? Imagine what you can get done... That's what Focus@Will helps you achieve. Our goal is to help you focus by creating music specifically designed to help you stay in a flow-state. The music you find on Focus@Will cannot be found anywhere else; we remaster, re-edit, and re-produce each track to remove all distracting elements so you can stay productive and focused. Focus@Will has thousands of hours of unique brain music to help you control your ADD. We create scientifically optimized music to help get you in a focus-flow state faster, and longer. How do I know if this will work for me? Our in-app assessment agent uses data from the biggest brain database in the world combined with our own data from 9 years of music brain research to prescribe which specific music type and energy level will work best for you. Our subscribers are entrepreneurs, freelancers, designers, writers, students, and include people that work in large corporations like; Google, Tesla, Apple, SpaceX and Microsoft. Who we are: We're an independent neuroscience company based in Los Angeles, California. Our mission is to empower you to be the best version of yourself; have a healthy work/life balance; and create fulfillment and happiness in your life. What sets us apart: We have a customized solution based on our connection to the biggest brain database in the world. Every audio mix is different for every user, and all the sounds and music we deliver are unique to our system. Our system manages the ratio between your endogenous attention (ie the task you are focusing on) and your exogenous attention (ie your reptile brain looking for potentially dangerous 'fight or flight' external stimuli). Every human is different, the types of music that helps calm this response is highly individual. (Fun fact: the more easily distracted you are, the more energy you need to help you focus. Now you'll know why our ADHD channel is the way it is!) Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, etc., we're big fans - but not when we're trying to be productive! The focus playlists found in these streaming services is usually someone's vague idea of what worked for them. When you want to get stuff done Focus@Will is the only option that was created specifically for your individual productivity needs{% endraw %}
