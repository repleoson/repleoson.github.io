{% raw %}Miniature basing is probably the easiest way to make a mini look awesome with minimal effort. In this tutorial my aim is to share the techniques and methods I use to make the bases on my miniatures blend with the terrain, but still look incredible on close inspection, as well as some other techniques I use to make the bases themselves far better for playing with!<br /><br />I play D&amp;D, but whether you do 40k, Warhammer Fantasy, Age of Sigmar, Star Wars Legion or one of the dozens of other games out there - basing is the quickest, easiest way to make any mini look awesome.<br /><br />For D&amp;D its amazing. Lots of D&amp;D minis look identical - basing gives them individuality. Some peoples D&amp;D minis are prepainted - basing rescues these (usually not great) paint jobs and helps them blend with the better painted minis you've done yourself.<br /><br />So yeah. I like basing. It lets you do some pretty amazing things, pretty easily. And it can be DIRT cheap too. Pun definitely intended :)<br /><br /><br />‚öîÔ∏è SUPPORT BY JOINING THE ARCHIVE ON PATREON: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/RPArchive">https://www.patreon.com/RPArchive</a> <br />üõ†Ô∏è SUPPORT BY BUYING EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/RPEquipment">http://bit.ly/RPEquipment</a><br /><br />Everything I use should be linked on the equipment list above, so it's also a library of where to find stuff‚Ä¶<br /><br />Speaking of finding stuff, here's where you can buy these kind of bases:<br /><br />20mm are small, 25mm are medium, 50mm large, 75mm huge, etc.<br /><br />Games workshop:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/100-x-25mm-base">https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/100-x-25mm-base</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Citadel-50mm-Round-Bases">https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Citadel-50mm-Round-Bases</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Citadel-75-46-Oval-Bases">https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Citadel-75-46-Oval-Bases</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Citadel-80-Round-Base">https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Citadel-80-Round-Base</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Citadel-100-Round-Base">https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Citadel-100-Round-Base</a><br /><br />Reaper:<br />20mm: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reapermini.com/miniatures/bases/latest/74041">https://www.reapermini.com/miniatures/bases/latest/74041</a><br />25mm: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reapermini.com/miniatures/bases/latest/74035">https://www.reapermini.com/miniatures/bases/latest/74035</a><br />75mm: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reapermini.com/miniatures/bases/latest/74066">https://www.reapermini.com/miniatures/bases/latest/74066</a><br /><br />3D printed:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/art/hollow-bases-2mm-wall">https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/art/hollow-bases-2mm-wall</a><br /><br /><br />üîî Subscribe and click the bell for more D&amp;D terrain!<br />üëç If you found this helpful, help me out and like the video up there!<br /><br />If you like the look of the grimdark stuff, check out Erics Hobby Workshop and Miscast - they do great stuff for 40k :)<br /><br />Miscast ruined buildings: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=818uEjtMD6E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=818uEjtMD6E</a><br />Erics 40k ruins: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RB-JdGEe_Q&amp;t=580s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RB-JdGEe_Q&amp;t=580s</a><br /><br />Other builds featured in this video:<br /><br />Grassland tiles: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DzvJIozUXWY">https://youtu.be/DzvJIozUXWY</a><br />Wall and temple system: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/om88iXGJ92s">https://youtu.be/om88iXGJ92s</a><br />Plinths and Buttresses (those small columns on the walls): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/tf4hgTLKw6M">https://youtu.be/tf4hgTLKw6M</a><br />Cavern Tiles (plaster rock painting): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/XIBUrcIkVAo">https://youtu.be/XIBUrcIkVAo</a><br /><br />00:00 intro<br />00:42 tricks using the base<br />02:07 how to update to better bases<br />03:08 Mini Storage<br />04:00 Core basing techniques<br />08:32 varying techniques for theme<br />08:50 Mountainous basing<br />10:23 Forest basing<br />12:33 Telling a story with the base<br />12:59 Grass tufts - how to make them and which ones to use<br />14:38 more extreme environments<br /><br /><br /><br />Check out my full modular terrain systems: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/RPArchiveChannel">http://bit.ly/RPArchiveChannel</a><br /><br />Follow the channel to make sure you catch new videos as they're released:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/RPArchiveFB">http://bit.ly/RPArchiveFB</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/RPArchiveINSTA">http://bit.ly/RPArchiveINSTA</a><br /><br />#Rparchive #basing #miniatures{% endraw %}
