{% raw %}Some games are decided not by chess skill, but by errors of judgement which seem incomprehensible afterwards. <br /><br />I made a practical mistake of trying to exploit my opponent's time trouble issues by playing quickly, tactically, and trying to complicate the position to make him blunder. The exact opposite happened instead. My moves were bad, I made mistakes, and I caught up in time trouble, wasting too much time on my moves because the position got harder and harder to play.<br /><br />When your opponent is low on time and the position is still complex and relatively calm, you have to play good, solid moves which don't make your position worse and which force your opponent to come up with a plan of his own. You shouldn't do what I did - play a move which is easy to calculate, giving your opponent something to focus on instead of spreading his attention to the entire board.<br /><br />Ciutat de Barcelona 2021, Round 9<br />Tomic S.
