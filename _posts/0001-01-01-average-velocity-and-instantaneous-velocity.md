{% raw %}This calculus video tutorial provides a basic introduction into average velocity and instantaneous velocity.  It explains how to find the velocity function from the position function by finding the first derivative.  It explains how to calculate the initial velocity of the object and the height of the building.  It discusses how to determine how long it will take before the ball hits the ground using the quadratic formula and how long it will take to reach the maximum height as well as determining the maximum height from the ground.  The average velocity represents the slope of the secant line of the position time graph and the instantaneous velocity if the slope of the tangent line to the graph.  <br /><br />Calculus Video Playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xATmTI-YY8&amp;t=25s&amp;list=PL0o_zxa4K1BWYThyV4T2Allw6zY0jEumv&amp;index=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xATmTI-YY8&amp;t=25s&amp;list=PL0o_zxa4K1BWYThyV4T2Allw6zY0jEumv&amp;index=1</a><br /><br />Access to Premium Videos:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor">https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MathScienceTutoring/">https://www.facebook.com/MathScienceTutoring/</a>{% endraw %}
