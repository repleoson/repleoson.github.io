This tutorial focuses on what corporations are, &quot;double taxation&quot; and a few ways that multinationals might try to get out of paying taxes.<br /><br />About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom.
