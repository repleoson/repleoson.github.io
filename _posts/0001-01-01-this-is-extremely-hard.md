{% raw %}I don't know what's next but I wanted to let you know to expect the unexpected with regards to the future of content here. I have several videos pre-shot as I was preparing to be too sick during my first trimester to even shoot, so you will see some of those rolling out of the next few weeks and months. Praying that the chemo works so that I can avoid surgery, but if any of you have any helpful information on going through something like this (whether it's chemo or ectopic pregnancy) please let me know. I am doing my best to get through this in one piece. Any prayers would be so appreciated. <br /><br />LET'S BE FRIENDS ON:<br />TikTok: HeyErinRobinson<br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/erinrobinson">https://www.instagram.com/erinrobinson</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/erinrobinson​​​">https://twitter.com/erinrobinson​​​</a> <br />SNAPCHAT: @HeyErinRobinson<br />DO YOU WANT TO WORK TOGETHER?: www.thecreatorcake.com<br /><br />Mailing Address<br />2355 Westwood Blvd.<br />930<br />Los Angeles, CA 90064{% endraw %}
