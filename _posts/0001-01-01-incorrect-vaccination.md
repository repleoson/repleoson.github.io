{% raw %}Basically, we need to change the vaccine administration guidelines to include precautionary aspiration, prior to pushing in the vaccine. This will prevent cases of inadvertent intravascular administration of vaccine.<br /><br />Here is some discussion to suggest inadvertent intravascular vaccine administration is a variable in the aetiology of complications after adenoviral vector vaccine administration and after mRNA vaccines.<br /><br />These adverse events, although rare have reduced public confidence in covid vaccination, especially amongst the young, where vaccine rates are lowest.<br /><br />It has long been known that intravenous injection of adenovirus leads to TTS in mice<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow"

/><br />Now, new covid vaccine specific work agrees with this previous work<br /><br />Thrombocytopenia and splenic platelet directed immune responses after intravenous ChAdOx1 nCov-19 administration

/>The authors conclude, ‘Our work contributes to the understanding of TTS and highlights accidental intravenous injection as potential mechanism for post-vaccination TTS.’ <br /><br />‘We show that intravenous but not intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 triggers platelet-adenovirus aggregate formation and platelet activation.’ <br /><br />‘Hence, safe intramuscular injection, with aspiration prior to injection, could be a potential preventive measure when administering adenovirus-based vaccines.’<br /><br />Also after giving mRNA vaccines<br /><br />A new study finds that giving mice intravenous mRNA vaccine also causes heart inflammation in mice. <br /><br />Intravenous Injection of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA Vaccine Can Induce Acute Myopericarditis in Mouse Model (August 2021)<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank"

that IV injection of vaccines might partially contribute to this clinical phenotype, thus warranting a reconsideration of the practice of IM injection without aspiration, which carries the risk of inadvertent IV injection.’ <br /><br />Agreement from ‘fact check’ from Leo Nicolai, Cardiology Fellow, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich:<br /><br />(German Centre for Cardiovascular

/><br />‘Indeed, there is peer-reviewed work showing in mice that possibly intravenous injection of mRNA vaccine leads to myocardial inflammation.’<br /><br />‘that intravenous injection of adenoviral vector based vaccine (AZ1222, ChAdOx1) leads to thrombocytopenia and platelet-directed immune responses, offering a possible explanation for vaccine-induced thrombosis/thrombocytopenia’<br /><br />‘these data might indicate a simple measure to lower the incidence of vaccine-induced side effects,’<br /><br />‘There is a lack of data on frequency and effects of IV injection in humans.’<br /><br
