{% raw %}By request:- A basic guide to identifying components and their functions for those who are new to electronics.  This is a work in progress, and I welcome feedback from you guys on whether I should break it down into more manageable chunks.  I've kept the maths to a minimum, since it can be off-putting to someone just getting started in electronics.<br />The idea of this video is to slot in some more of the jigsaw pieces involved in learning electronics, when you start to recognise components, but aren't quite sure what they are or what they do.<br />It's tricky to squeeze even the basics into a single video, and I've just realised how long this one is (and why it took all night to upload).<br /><br /><br />If you enjoy my videos you can support the channel with a dollar for coffee, cookies and components at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/bigclive">https://www.patreon.com/bigclive</a>{% endraw %}
