{% raw %}The Covid-19 pandemic and the worsening climate crisis continue to expose many of the shortcomings in the global multilateral system. Inequality and poverty are on the rise, making women and marginalized groups particularly vulnerable. The world needs new visions of fiscal solidarity, ecologic sustainability and the protection of human rights.<br /><br />With this second event as part of our publication series on the Future of Multilateralism, we continue the conversation on pathways to a just, sustainable and democratic international order that takes into account the needs and priorities of the most vulnerable people and communities.<br /><br />In the second of two events, we explore how to protect human rights and particularly gender rights in multilateral efforts to address issues ranging from climate finance to the governance of data and digital technologies. Inputs by authors in our series are be the basis for a high-level panel discussion among policymakers from the European Union, the United States and the United Nations.{% endraw %}
