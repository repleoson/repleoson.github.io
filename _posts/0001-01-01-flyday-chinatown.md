{% raw %}keeping the uploads going lol. i've always wanted to edit this song and always wanted to make an inuyasha edit so here it is. just a short loop but figured it was still worth uploading, hope you guys like it!<br /><br />follow my instagram: @aspects.amv<br /><br />interested in supporting me even more? if you would like to donate to me, I would truly appreciate it! All proceeds will be used to further improve my editing software, since most add-ons cannot be found for free. anything is appreciated, but regardless of what you choose to do, i love ya'll for supporting me.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/aspectsamv​​​">https://www.paypal.me/aspectsamv​​​</a><br /><br />anime: inuyasha<br />song: yashua - flyday chinatown<br />(coincidence that the artist name and anime name are almost the same? xD){% endraw %}
