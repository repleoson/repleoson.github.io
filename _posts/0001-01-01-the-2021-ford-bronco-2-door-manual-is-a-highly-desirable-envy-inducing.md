{% raw %}It's been 25 years since we've seen a new #FordBronco in America. Its back and its really damn good. This #BroncoBlackDiamond 2-Door is the enthusiast friendly option with the 7-speed MT and a starting price of around $36,000. While this #Bronco is missing the off-road ready Sasquatch package, it still proves to be plenty capable off-road while being immensely comfortable on the road.  <br />We also want to give a shoutout to our friend Bern for helping us out with the off-road footage.
