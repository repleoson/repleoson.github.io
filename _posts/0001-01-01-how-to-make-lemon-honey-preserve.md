{% raw %}Here is a very simple way to preserve lemons. All you need is a clean mason jar, lemons and honey. Its just that easy. I also like to add sliced fresh ginger. A few spoons of this amazing liquid and hot water makes a perfect cup of tea. The health benefits alone are worth giving this recipe a try. The combination of the lemons and raw local honey can aid in gut, immune system and even skin health. This recipe is a great way to either maintain or even give you a boost to your immune system. <br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />2 to 3 medium to large lemons (be sure to thoroughly wash)<br />1 to 1 1/2 cups honey (I used raw local honey)<br />12 oz mason jar (I boiled jar in water for 10 to 12 minutes)<br /><br /><br />How to Preserve Lemons<br />Honey Lemon Preserve Recipe<br />How to make Lemon Honey Tea<br />Healthy Recipe<br />Preserve Lemons Quick and Easy<br />How to Boost Your Immune System<br />How to fight the Common Cold<br />How to Preserve Lemons in Honey<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Music: <br /><br />George Street Shuffle by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1300035">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1300035</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a><br /><br />Cherry Blossom - Wonders by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100382">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100382</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a><br /><br />Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music">http://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music</a><br />Song Title: Jazz Comedy{% endraw %}
