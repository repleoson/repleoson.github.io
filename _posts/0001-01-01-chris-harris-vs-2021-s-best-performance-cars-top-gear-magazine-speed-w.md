{% raw %}From Alfa to Zenvo and everything in between, including a £130k Mini, an actual Dakar car, very fast McLaren, crazy Lamborghini and hybrid Ferrari, this is what happens when you unleash Chris Harris and his opinions on the class of 2021. So strap in and prepare for some hot takes.<br /> <br />For this year’s Top Gear Magazine Speed Week, for reasons not entirely of our own making, our annual Perfmorance Car of the Year Test returned for the first time in nine years to the Top Gear test track in tropical Dunsfold, and that deserved recognition. Go big or go home? We went big and went home, assembling the largest group of contenders we’ve ever had – 26 in total, with 12,440bhp between them – much to the irritation of our insurers.<br /> <br />Desperate to know what won the whole thing?
