{% raw %}Access Hollywood spoke to gymnast Suni Lee and her partner Sasha Farber following their “Dancing With The Stars” performance. The duo had an emotional performance and Suni admits that, “It’s definitely scary because everybody knows me as Suni the gymnast and that’s always strong and won the Olympics but I feel like people are so quick to judge, she said. “So it’s really difficult when I do actually show emotion because I don’t know what people are going to say and I’m the type of person who takes what everyone says into consideration...” “DWTS” airs Monday nights on ABC.{% endraw %}
