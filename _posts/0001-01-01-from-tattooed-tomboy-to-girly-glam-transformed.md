Describing her style as androgynous and tomboy, Holly has tattoos on the side of her head, while her neck and forearms are inked entirely black and she wears her hair short and bleached. Holly got her first tattoo when she was 18 but started getting more heavily tattooed from age 21 and is aiming for 80% coverage. Holly says she has been a tomboy “from the womb” and she typically dresses in oversized tees and shorts or ripped jeans from unisex or men’s brands, including her own clothing line. Holly wore trousers at school and was head girl. Everyone expected her to wear a suit at prom so she wore a black and blue corset with a black skirt. However, In her current wardrobe she has no skirts or dresses and has never worn heels. What then will she make of a girly glam transformation with a dress straight out of prom? <br /><br />Follow Holly Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/holly_inked/">https://www.instagram.com/holly_inked/</a> <br /><br />Clothing line: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/moonboi_designs/">https://www.instagram.com/moonboi_designs/</a><br />Skincare line: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hinked_skin/">https://www.instagram.com/hinked_skin/</a><br />MUA: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/victoriastride/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/victoriastride/?hl=en</a><br /><br />Videographer: Jan-Paul Bednarz<br />Producers: Nathalie Bonney, Ruby Coote<br />Editor: Helen Mckee<br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
