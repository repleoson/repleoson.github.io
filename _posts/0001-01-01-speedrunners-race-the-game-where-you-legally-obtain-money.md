{% raw %}Should I switch to Payday 2 speedrunning? Well, I gave it a try with Smallant, EazySpeezy, and Pointcrow as we tried to speedrun different Payday 2 levels.<br /><br />merch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simply64store.com/">https://simply64store.com/</a><br />twitch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/simply">https://twitch.tv/simply</a><br />twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64">https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64</a><br />soundcloud ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/simply64">https://soundcloud.com/simply64</a><br /><br />Edited by eriksenchee<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/eriksenchee">https://twitter.com/eriksenchee</a><br /><br />Simplys speedruns Payday 2 with EazySpeezy, Smallant, and Pointcrow. Payday 2 2022 speedrunning is cool, should I speedrun Hitman with Atrioc? Maybe he can teach me some speedrunning techniques. Clint Stevens mario said that he'll be coming to Mizkif's house in Austin, TX by the end of the year. We could have a Super Mario 64 120 Speedrunning race. Maybe after I make content with him he'll get the SM64 World Record, just like Liam Mario 64 World Record. Anyways, I'm the speedrunning guy. I speed run mario and Every Single Game. I have all the records on speedrun.com. Don't check it though you have to trust.{% endraw %}
