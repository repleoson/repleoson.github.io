{% raw %}Host: Andrew Farley<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Christian world complicates what is simple. Salvation is simple and straightforward. The Bible plainly says &quot;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved&quot;. When you get hold of this simple message you understand you are saved and sustained by God. * UNITED Conference - October 15-17, 2021 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://basicgospel.net/united/">https://basicgospel.net/united/</a> * Carol asks how to know for sure she is saved. * Clay asks about Romans 8:4-5. Is the mind of man hostile to God? * Robert asks about Matthew 7:22-23. Is this passage talking about unbelievers or believers? * Louis asks about 1 John 3. Does this mean that believers do not sin? * Chris asks why would God cast Satan down to earth and then put his creation in the same place? * Kurt asks about 'seek and ye shall find'. Haven't we already found Him?<br /><br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />For more information visit:<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://basicgospel.net">https://basicgospel.net</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/rcchristopherjr">https://twitter.com/rcchristopherjr</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/basicgospel">https://www.facebook.com/basicgospel</a><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/basicgospel">https://www.youtube.com/basicgospel</a><br />Daily Devotional: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://basicgospel.net/subscribe">https://basicgospel.net/subscribe</a><br /><br />Support the ministry: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://basicgospel.net/support">https://basicgospel.net/support</a>{% endraw %}
