{% raw %}Προσοχή δεν το βάζουμε σε εξωτερικούς χώρους να μην βρέχετε <br />σας ευχαριστώ<br /> <br /><br />Sometimes the wall outlets are just not enough, so a simple solution is a multi socket power strip.  And sometimes it's quite handy to have it attached somewhere, like on a wall or on a bench or under the kitchen cabinets. <br />Most of these power strips can be disassembled, so it's very easy to put them in convenient places. <br />As you can see in the video, after we connect the wires, we can pierce the prefabricated holes with a sharp object, and use screws to attach them on the wall. <br />Pretty straight forward job. <br />The important thing is to be careful of the total power it can handle. We must not exceed the rated power of the power strip, because we may catch fire or damage the plastic. The total power it can handle is printed in the back, so always pay attention to the devices you connect. <br />And also be careful not to have it outside. They are only  made for indoor use, and if they can be placed outside, there will usualy be some kind of symbol in the back to inform the public They will also be a bit on the expensive side. <br />Another useful feature of a power strip is the surge protection. The cheap ones usualy don't have any protection, but the more expensive ones do, so choose wisely. <br />And finaly, make sure the connections are properly done. The colored wires can be connected in either position, but the grounding wire (yellow/green) should always be connected to the groungind pins. <br />It is a matter of safety, so pay realy good attention to that one. <br />And if you can't trust yourself to do it, call a certified electrician to do it for you.<br /><br />Thanks for watching, and if you like what you see, consider subscribing{% endraw %}
