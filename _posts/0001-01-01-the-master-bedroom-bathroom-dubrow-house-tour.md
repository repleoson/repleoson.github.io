{% raw %}Welcome to where the MAGIC happens! <br /><br />Designing this area of the house was especially important to me because it’s where we spend a lot of our time! And in our last house Terry wasn’t in love with the master, so I really wanted to make sure he loved this room as much as the others! <br /><br />What did you guys think??? <br /><br />Make sure to like and subscribe! <br /><br />Xx<br />Heather{% endraw %}
