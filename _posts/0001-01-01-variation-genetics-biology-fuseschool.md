{% raw %}Variation | Genetics |  Biology | FuseSchool<br /><br />Look at these baby animals. You will have immediately observed how cute and fluffy they are but you will<br />also have noticed that they are different - they vary. Yes - some are puppies and some are kittens.<br />There is a great deal of variation between species but also there is variation within a species. One<br />puppy is fluffier than the other, they have different colour fur and the kittens have different coloured eyes.<br />Variation is the differences in the characteristics of individuals in a population. It can be due to genetics,<br />the environment or a combination of both.<br />Letâ€™s start with genetics. Different members of a population have different DNA, unless they are identical<br />twins. This means they have different versions of genes, called alleles, and these alleles give rise to<br />different characteristics.<br />For example, on the eye colour gene this kitten has an allele for blue eye colour whereas this kitten has<br />an allele for brown eye colour.<br />If the species reproduces by sexual reproduction, the random mixing of alleles from both parents results<br />in extensive genetic variation within a population of a species. This means that some individuals are<br />better adapted to their environment than others, allowing natural selection to take place. For example, in<br />a population of rats, some will have better eyesight than others. These will be able to avoid being eaten<br />by predators so are more likely to survive to reproduce and pass on this advantage to their offspring. If<br />you want to learn more about natural selection, watch this video. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-COGCN3U9I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-COGCN3U9I</a><br /><br />Some examples of variation in humans that are controlled only by genes include eye colour and blood<br />group. If you have blood group A it is because you have the alleles for this characteristic. This is genetic<br />variation, and it is something that you were born with, and nothing can change it.<br />Some variation is due to the environment, or lifestyle of the organisms. Examples in humans are hair<br />length (it depends on how short you decide to cut it), your accent, as this is linked to where you live and<br />if you have any piercings, tattoos or scars. These are characteristics that you acquire throughout your<br />life.<br />Many characteristics are due to a combination of both genetics and the environment. For example, the<br />height a person can grow to is determined by genetics - tall parents tend to produce tall children.<br />However, a person will not grow to their potential height unless they eat a healthy, balanced diet. Also,<br />there is some debate on how much intelligence is due to genetics or the quality of education a person<br />receives - is intelligence more due to nature or nurture?<br />To answer these questions scientists can do experiments using identical twins. If the characteristic in<br />both twins is the same then it is most likely due to genetics. If it is different, then the environment has<br />played an important role. For example, identical twins will have the same eye colour as this is only due to<br />genetics but they will have different personalities, talents, likes and dislikes and this shows that these are<br />also influenced by the environment.<br />So, in this video we learnt about variation, and how it can be controlled by genetics, the environment or<br />sometimes both.<br /><br /><br /><br />CREDITS<br />Animation &amp; Design: Waldi Apollis<br />Narration: Dale Bennett<br />Script: Lucy Billings<br /><br />SUPPORT US ON PATREON<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/fuseschool">https://www.patreon.com/fuseschool</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to the FuseSchool YouTube channel for many more educational videos.
