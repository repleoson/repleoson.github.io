{% raw %}**I'm sure there will be lots of questions so if you have any for us, just leave them in the comments and we can try to film a Q&amp;A video soon for you!**<br /><br />We just want to thank you SO much for all the LOVE and support we've received after our last video post! We're so thankful for each and every one of you! God has a plan...We don't know exactly what that looks like yet...but we are excited to see what He has in store for us. &quot;Easy&quot; has never been promised to any of us, but He is faithful to carry us through any circumstance, and there is so much beauty in the journey. We love you all! <br /><br />This channel is about our daily life raising our 2 boys and our daughter who has Down Syndrome. <br /><br />When we first found out about Eva's diagnosis we couldn't find many YouTube channels from families in the same situation, which is why we decided to start this channel.<br /><br /><br /><br />We are just a simple, average family sharing the joys (and sometimes the challenges) that raising a child with Down Syndrome have brought to our life!{% endraw %}
