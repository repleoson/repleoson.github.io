{% raw %}Colin is amazing!  No, he did NOT run at world record pace, but he gave it his all in Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.  Colin ran the walking route for what was billed as a 8k run/3 mile walk.  But we just drove the course and it looks like the route is a half mile short!  So that explains his speedy pace!  But great job to Colin for giving his best effort to help other children!<br />   <br />September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.
