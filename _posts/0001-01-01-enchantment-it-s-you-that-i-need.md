{% raw %}Enchantment performing It's You That I Need. (C) 1977 Roadshow<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Something strange is happening<br />You don't belong to me anymore<br />It seems I'm all alone<br />In my dreams<br />I just feel so weak<br />No one knows the pain I see<br />When I'm all alone<br />Now that you're gone<br />My world is cold<br />My friends are few<br />Without you here<br />My joy seems cruel<br />When you left you took part of me<br />What can I do<br />It's you that I need, baby<br />It's you that I need<br />I'm lonely<br />It's you that I need, come back<br />Something's gone in me<br />You were my life, my mystery baby<br />How could you do this to me<br />Left me holding on to a memory<br />I tried, I tried to be good<br />Take you to a place no others could<br />I suddenly woke and found you gone<br />Now I sing my heart to you<br />Through the words of this song<br />Something happened to me<br />You were my life, my destiny<br />My life will never, ever be complete<br />Come back to me<br />It's you that I need baby, baby<br />It's you that I need<br />Come back to me<br /><br />#Enchantment #ItsYouThatINeed{% endraw %}
