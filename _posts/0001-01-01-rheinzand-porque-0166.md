{% raw %}Rheinzand releases their amazing self-titled debut album 'Rheinzand' on Music For Dreams. Available in all digital stores: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://music-for-dreams.lnk.to/rheinzandFA">https://music-for-dreams.lnk.to/rheinzandFA</a><br /><br />After much anticipation, our Belgian disco diamonds Rheinzand present their debut full-length album. On their self-titled record, The Belgian trio wraps the human heart in synthetic threads of modular electronic disco. 9 songs writhing on timeless dancefloors, morphing in and out of shapes of luxuriant melody and vivid instrumentation.<br /><br />The album is full of classic disco and electro sounds, wielded with imposing prowess by multi- instrumentalist Reinhard Vanbergen. It’s both an exploration of dance music’s electronic genealogy and the vintage cool that has defined its different eras. Still, an organic atmosphere pervades as the blend of real instrumentation fixes a sort of retro-futurism, imagining an alternative timeline that’s a bit more exciting, more sensuous and libidinal, maybe more human, too, than our current outlook.<br /><br />We start the engines with Break of Dawn, a compelling beat rises from the basement and soon we’re submerged by the pulsing bassline. Dark sunglasses on, we cruise through the night, letting flashing city lights flow into unbroken torrents of color. Blind awakens us, a splash of handclaps in the face, vivid strings and Charlotte’s trademark slick vocals enter the stage. Tantalizing sunbeams power up circuits of electronic synths blipping and beeping away.<br /><br />Later down the road, we hit the Latin part of town. Porque fits enchanting vocal spells in beautiful Spanish on playful flamenco rhythms. Fourteen Again is a throwback to early electro, playing around with knobs and buttons. An oscillating synth imagines new worlds of plastic<br /><br />emotion. Still disco and still very cool, though. A constant velocity is sustained throughout the album by this recurring locomotive synth, trudging away beneath the action. Once in a while, we hear the deep, mighty, trembling voice of Mr. Rheinzand speaking to us in incantations. Someone’s pulling the strings here.<br /><br />On Slippery People, the trio cover the Talking Heads classic in a characteristic procedure of bouncy funk. We’re swirled around by the delirious glasswork of You Don’t Know Me into the hypnagogic funk noir of Strange World. Drifting through the house of mirrors after the fourth mojito.<br /><br />Obey collects all these threads in a full-bodied future classic disco anthem, before Queen of The Dawn wraps up the show with a sky-bound epic of operatic choirs and ceremonious drums that lands somewhere between Kate Bush’s Aerial and Peter Gabriel’s most bombastic.<br /><br />Connect with Rheinzand:<br />FB: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Rheinzand/">https://www.facebook.com/Rheinzand/</a><br />SC: @rheinzand<br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rheinzand/?hl=da">https://www.instagram.com/rheinzand/?hl=da</a><br /><br />Connect with Music For Dreams<br />FB : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2MEexC2">https://bit.ly/2MEexC2</a><br />SC : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2w0qOqR">https://bit.ly/2w0qOqR</a><br />YT : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2bIaezU">https://bit.ly/2bIaezU</a><br />IG : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Le2u9s">https://bit.ly/2Le2u9s</a><br />TW : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2L9HyjX">https://bit.ly/2L9HyjX</a><br />BC : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2MRzxGj">https://bit.ly/2MRzxGj</a><br />Home : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Psgksm">https://bit.ly/2Psgksm</a><br /><br />Connect with Kenneth Bager<br />FB : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2N58gfy">https://bit.ly/2N58gfy</a><br />SC : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2mgVZsd">https://bit.ly/2mgVZsd</a><br />YT : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2bIaezU">https://bit.ly/2bIaezU</a><br />IG : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2w0p8NY">https://bit.ly/2w0p8NY</a><br />TW : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2nTndX1">https://bit.ly/2nTndX1</a><br />BC : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2MRzxGj">https://bit.ly/2MRzxGj</a><br />Home : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Psgksm">https://bit.ly/2Psgksm</a>{% endraw %}
