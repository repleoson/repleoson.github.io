{% raw %}#hairloss #damagedhair #blackwoman<br /><br />It’s been well over a decade since this beauty last wore her real hair. As u can see all the stress it has been thru over the years of wearing extensions. It was very dry and distressed until I got done ‼️<br />It’s about the 5D coloring for me…<br /><br />DON’T PLAY WIT HER😻😻😻😻<br /><br />Words by:: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/theofficialrazorchic">https://instagram.com/theofficialrazorchic</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://razorchic.com/">https://razorchic.com/</a> <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/gilliangarciaartistry">https://instagram.com/gilliangarciaartistry</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gilliangarcia.com/">https://gilliangarcia.com/</a>{% endraw %}
