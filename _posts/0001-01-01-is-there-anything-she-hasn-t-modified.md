{% raw %}The car world is an awful lot larger than just 'supercars' and chatting to QueenB during the launch of the new McLaren 570S Spider shows just that! She talks through the modifications to her BMW E21 and I haven't got a clue...<br /><br />The McLaren 570S Spider is of course also a topic of discussion, and the fact that we're able to share these videos and give you different insights to driving these cars. What do you think Fuel For Thought videos including different people to ask them about their areas of interest? <br /><br />You can find Becky on her channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLPmXARqER7Ri8UAk0QLGpQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLPmXARqER7Ri8UAk0QLGpQ</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching, Tim<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Shmee150YT">http://bit.ly/Shmee150YT</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.shmee150.com">http://www.shmee150.com</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.fb.com/shmee150">http://www.fb.com/shmee150</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/shmee150">http://www.instagram.com/shmee150</a>{% endraw %}
