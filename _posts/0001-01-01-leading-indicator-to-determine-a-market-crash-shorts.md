{% raw %}I'm not telling you how to predict the market crash, we are just using this as an additional confirmation indicator because there are lots of factors that you'll need to take into account when it comes to determining when is a stock market going to crash. Bond yields have been a leading indicator of crashes over the past 50 years. Even though it is not always reliable, we can use it as a confirmation indicator in addition to our overall analysis. <br /><br />It is also a useful leading indicator for forex and commodities traders. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/EYQGJMjNXYg">https://youtu.be/EYQGJMjNXYg</a>{% endraw %}
