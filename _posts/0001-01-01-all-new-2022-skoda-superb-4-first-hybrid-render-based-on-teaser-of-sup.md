{% raw %}New Skoda Superb 2022-2023 4 gen has been rendered for the first time based on the recent sketches leaked, where possibly new Skoda Superb IV 2022 was shown with Sedan and Combi models redesign.<br /><br />The next generation of Superb release date must be planned not earlier than for late 2022 or early 2023 with upgraded specs - more efficient iV plug-in hybrid versions and maybe even all-electric variant.<br /><br />We tried to follow the provided teasers and illustrate the new Skoda Superb 2023 liftback with headlights and grill partly partly taken from last Skoda Octavia IV. Generally the design direction of the future Skoda models (according to sketches) will remain the same and will follow the following rules:<br /><br />- Powerdome and Skoda-typical grill;<br />- Crystalline design language;<br />- Crystalline C-shaped taillights;<br />- DLO and Skoda line;<br />- Spacious Proportions.<br /><br />Let's take a look at our renderings and let us know which color you would choose. We illustrated the future Superb model in4th generation (mk4) with most popular grey, white, silver, black, blue, brown, red, and green colors.<br /><br />#SkodaSuperb #SkodaSuperbIV #SkodaSuperb4 #SkodaSuperb2022 #SkodaSuperb2023 #SkodaSuperbHybrid{% endraw %}
