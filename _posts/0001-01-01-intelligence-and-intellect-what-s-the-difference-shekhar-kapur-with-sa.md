{% raw %}Sadhguru looks at how a human being is capable of employing intelligence, without the intellect. He explains that the human existence is phenomenal intelligence. We can't make our heart beat or kidney or liver work with the thought process. The thought process is important for certain aspects of life, but it is entirely unsuitable for other aspects of life.<br /><br />#Sadhguru<br />Yogi, mystic and visionary, Sadhguru is a spiritual master with a difference. An arresting blend of profundity and pragmatism, his life and work serves as a reminder that yoga is a contemporary science, vitally relevant to our times. <br /><br />Sadhguru Exclusive (Register Now)<br />⚡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://isha.co/ex-yt">http://isha.co/ex-yt</a> <br /><br />Sadhguru App (Download)<br />📱 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://onelink.to/sadhguru__app">http://onelink.to/sadhguru__app</a><br /><br />Official Sadhguru Website <br />🌎 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://isha.sadhguru.org">http://isha.sadhguru.org</a> <br /><br />Donate Towards Crafting A Conscious Planet<br />🙏 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://isha.co/sanghamitra-yt﻿">http://isha.co/sanghamitra-yt﻿</a><br /><br />Offerings from Sadhguru in Challenging Times <br />🌼 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://isha.sadhguru.org/sadhana-support">https://isha.sadhguru.org/sadhana-support</a><br /><br />Guided Yoga &amp; Meditations by Sadhguru (Free Online)<br />🌼 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://isha.sadhguru.org/5-min-practices">http://isha.sadhguru.org/5-min-practices</a><br />🌼 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://isha.sadhguru.org/IshaKriya">http://isha.sadhguru.org/IshaKriya</a><br /><br />Inner Engineering Online Program<br />🌼 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://isha.co/IEO-YT">http://isha.co/IEO-YT</a> (Register Now)<br /><br />Official Social Profiles of Sadhguru  (Subscribe)<br />🌐 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/sadhguru?sub_confirmation=1">https://youtube.com/sadhguru?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />🌐 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/sadhguru">https://facebook.com/sadhguru</a><br />🌐 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/sadhguru">https://instagram.com/sadhguru</a><br />🌐 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SadhguruJV">https://twitter.com/SadhguruJV</a><br />🌐 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.me/Sadhguru">https://t.me/Sadhguru</a>{% endraw %}
