{% raw %}The Chicago Chromatography Discussion Group Presents<br />Optimizing SPME for a Variety of Applications<br />Bob Shirey, Yong Chen and Craig Aurand Supelco<br /><br />Solid phase microextraction (SPME) is a solvent free extraction technique developed in 1993 that can be utilized in a variety of applications. This versatile extraction technique is used to extract volatile, semi-volatile and non-volatile analytes from gas, liquid or solid matrices. A portion of this presentation will focus on how to select the appropriate fiber for your application and provide techniques for improving the extraction efficiency of target analytes. Guidelines will be given on how to quantify analytes using SPME. In addition to coverage of traditional SPME applications, this presentation will highlight new developments in SPME. The use of over-coated SPME fibers for extraction of analytes out of more complex matrices will be shown. Also, a new SPME platform for biological applications has been developed. Biocompatible SPME fibers can be used  for extraction of small molecules such as drugs out of biological matrices. For these applications, the extracted nonvolatile analytes are either solvent desorbed followed by LC-MS, or the fibers can be directly coupled with a mass spec source using DESI or DART interface devices.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />The Chicago Chromatography Discussion Group (CCDG) is committed to promoting an interest in -and providing a forum for- the exchange of information in all areas of chromatography.  CCDG offers a program of luncheon or dinner meetings which cover advances in the many facets of chromatography. Our courses in gas and liquid chromatography provide outstanding basic and advanced training through lectures and hands-on experience.
