{% raw %}I've tried the air compressor method. The cable tie method. But this method is the best. Sometimes your scooter grips might be old and need swapping out. Or maybe you just want some fresh new ones. Here is the best method to swap out those grips.<br /><br />If using a box cutter / razor blade please be careful. Always cut away from yourself, not towards yourself.  If you aren't sure always get the help of an adult. <br /><br /><br />Under Licence,  Music used from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.FesliyanStudios.com">https://www.FesliyanStudios.com</a>{% endraw %}
