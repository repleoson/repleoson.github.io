{% raw %}What does it mean to be converted? It means to be fundamentally transformed from one thing to another. But conversion is a litmus test for how far along you are in your faith. When God converts you, He will change the very essence of who you are by testing your resolve and your reasoning for following Him. To be converted means to dispel former positions, see new perspectives, unlock your true potential, be provided for by God, and achieve the great promise He has for you! Whatever you‚Äôre facing can be conquered when you convert potential to practice.
