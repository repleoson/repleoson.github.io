{% raw %}Kiss your perfect day goodbye. Listen to Woodkid's &quot;Guns for Hire&quot; off the Arcane Original Soundtrack.<br /><br />Riot Games presents Arcane, a new animated streaming television series on Netflix from the world of League of Legends. In the cities of Piltover and Zaun, unrest stirs as inventors and thieves, politicians and crime lords chafe against the constraints of a society torn asunder. As dissent reaches a fever pitch, two sisters steal an artifact of untold power. Discovery and danger intertwine as heroes are born and bonds are broken. Will this power change the world, or lead it to ruin? This is the world of Arcane. Champions Jinx and Vi struggle to overcome their shared past in a new era of magic and technology.<br /><br />PRODUCTION CREDITS<br />Guns for Hire<br />Featured artist: Woodkid<br />Written by: Alex Seaver of Mako<br />Produced by: Alex Seaver of Mako, Woodkid<br />Vocals by: Woodkid<br />Mixed by: Chris Tabron<br />Mastered by: Dave Kutch (Mastering Palace)<br /><br />Woodkid appears courtesy of Virgin Records<br /><br />LISTEN NOW: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/gunsforhire">https://found.ee/gunsforhire</a>   <br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/gunsforhire-spotify">https://found.ee/gunsforhire-spotify</a><br />Apple Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/gunsforhire-applemusic">https://found.ee/gunsforhire-applemusic</a><br />Amazon Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/gunsforhire-amazonmusic">https://found.ee/gunsforhire-amazonmusic</a><br />Youtube Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/gunsforhire-youtube">https://found.ee/gunsforhire-youtube</a><br />Deezer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/gunsforhire-deezer">https://found.ee/gunsforhire-deezer</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/woodkidmusic">https://www.instagram.com/woodkidmusic</a><br /><br />LYRICS<br />Hold the die, your turn to roll<br />Before they fall through your fingers<br />Not a good night to lose control<br />Right as the earth is unraveling<br /><br />You play with your blocks until they break<br />And these walls come tumbling down<br />Oh they’re tumbling down<br /><br />You’re out time, make your move<br />Live or die while the fuse is lit and there’s no turning back<br /><br />Kiss your perfect day goodbye<br />Because the world is on fire<br />Tuck your innocence goodnight<br />You sold your friends like guns for hire<br />Go play with your blocks<br />And now you’ll pay when these walls come tumbling down<br />Oh they’re tumbling down<br /><br />Resting on a knife, you heavy souls<br />With all this weight buckling down on you now<br />Don’t you drown, and float away<br />Not a good time to lose control<br />Right as your marionettes cut their strings and run away<br /><br />You’re out time, make your move<br />Live or die while the fuse is lit and there’s no turning back<br /><br />Kiss your perfect day goodbye<br />Because the world is on fire<br />Tuck your innocence goodnight<br />You sold your friends like guns for hire<br />Go play with your blocks<br />And now you’ll pay when these walls come tumbling down<br />Oh they’re tumbling down<br /><br />From Arcane League of Legends, Soundtrack from the Animated Series<br />November 6 // November 13 // November 20<br />The #Arcane soundtrack drops in three releases.{% endraw %}
