{% raw %}Activist and author Michael Shellenberger says many people who used to be &quot;big advocates&quot; of renewables came to understand the limits of them.<br /><br />&quot;We now understand that we need nuclear power,&quot; Mr Shellenberger told Sky News Australia.<br /><br />Mr Shellenberger said he was &quot;absolutely&quot; opposed to nuclear energy in the past. <br /><br />&quot;I was raised to be anti-nuclear.&quot;<br /><br />However, Mr Shellenberger said, &quot;the truth is that we could produce all of our energy from nuclear right now&quot;. <br /><br />&quot;There's always a period of time where people need to get accustomed to the new technology.<br /><br />&quot;The main obstacle is really psychological - it's ideological, political obstacle - the existing technology is really quite good. <br /><br />&quot;We've been using it for over 60 years.&quot;<br /><br />You can stream Sky News Australia live and watch programs on demand with Flash.
