{% raw %}In his memoir, Mohamed Badredine Tachouche introspectively and humorously tells the story of the dramatic and improbable changes of a young Algerian artist to becoming an Imam, Islamist, presenter of religious TV shows, theologian, Sufi, blasphemer, lover and wanderer. Iâ€™m Ex Imam is a unique testimonial about the social, religious and political backgrounds of the indoctrination of youth, the makings of radicalism and the taboos within religious communities in the Islamic World. The book brings readers inside the Imamâ€™s world, from his private devotional and spiritual moments to his daily tasks as a clergyman and public personality. Itâ€™s a story of an Imam who chose to draw and sing to echo each chapter of his journey, and also to tell you that God and religion are not what he studied, preached and taught for years but what his mum and dad told him when he was a little kid.<br /><br /><br />Subscribe to Muhammad's channel @Badr Tachouche - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrLXaI5UAlaPVg3E-umZOqA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrLXaI5UAlaPVg3E-umZOqA</a><br /><br />===========================================<br /><br /><br />MythVision Website:  ðŸ”¥   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mythvisionpodcast.com/">https://mythvisionpodcast.com/</a><br />MythVision Patreon    ðŸ‘‰  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/mythvision">https://www.patreon.com/mythvision</a><br />MythVision  Paypal.    ðŸ‘‰  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/dereklambert7">https://www.paypal.me/dereklambert7</a> <br />Cashapp:                       ðŸ‘‰  $rewiredaddiction<br />Venmo:                          ðŸ‘‰  @Derek-Lambert-9<br />Recommeded books   ðŸ‘‰  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35FqNYf">https://amzn.to/35FqNYf</a> <br />Email MythVision         ðŸ‘‰  mythvisionpodcast@gmail.com <br />Facebook page:            ðŸ‘‰  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MythVision/">https://www.facebook.com/MythVision/</a><br />Facebook group:          ðŸ‘‰  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheWaterBoyZRadio/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheWaterBoyZRadio/</a><br />Twitter:                           ðŸ‘‰  @DerekPodcast   <br />Instagram:                     ðŸ‘‰  @dereklambert_7<br />MythVision Discord:      <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/dRQXdZBq6E">https://discord.gg/dRQXdZBq6E</a><br /><br />#Ex-Imam #Islam #MythVision{% endraw %}
