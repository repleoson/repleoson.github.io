That is the question.<br />But I forget you don't expect an easy answer.<br />When something like a soul becomes initialized and folded up like<br />Paper dolls and little notes, you can't expect a bit of hope<br />So while you're outside looking in, describing what you see<br />Remember what you're starting at is me.<br /><br />Cause I'm looking at you through the glass<br />Don't know how much times has passed,<br />Oh God it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you that<br />Forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head<br /><br />How much is real?  So much to question.<br />An epidemic of the mannequins contaminating everything<br />We thought came from the heart, but never did right from the start<br />Just listen to the noises - null and void instead of voices<br />Before you tell yourself it's just a different scene<br />Remember it's just different from what you see<br /><br />I'm looking at you through the glass, don't know how much times has passed,<br />All I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you that<br />Forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head<br /><br />And it's the stars, the stars that shine for you<br />And it's the stars, the stars that lie to you<br />And it's the stars, the stars that shine for you<br />And it's the stars, the stars that lie to you<br /><br />I'm looking at you through the glass, don't know how much times has passed,<br />All I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you that<br />Forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head<br /><br />Cause I'm looking at you through the glass<br />Don't know how much times has passed,<br />Oh God it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you that<br />Forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head<br /><br />And it's the stars, the stars that shine for you<br />And it's the stars, the stars that lie to you<br />And it's the stars, the stars that shine for you<br />And it's the stars, the stars that lie to you{% endraw %}
