{% raw %}Today's show begins with a look at some of this year's September 11 memorial ceremonies, which were held exactly 20 years after the terrorist attacks took place. Afterward, we're taking a walk in space and talking to an astronaut to see exactly what it's like to work in orbit. And we're showing you how a space balloon could take passengers up, up and away.{% endraw %}
