{% raw %}Welcome to this intensive 7-day weight loss challenge! This is a 22-minute video workout designed to help you burn 10 pounds (4.5 kg) in a week.<br /><br />This is not a guarantee of course but by doing this exercise training everyday you will definitely see results on your body.<br /><br />That's because the exercises are selected in a way to include strength exercises (lower, upper body and core) but also full-body cardio exercises.<br /><br />This will help build a small caloric deficit in your body, and if you keep your nutrition in order then you should see fat loss results in 7 days.<br /><br />About nutrition - don't stress too much over it. I recommend you follow just 2 simple rules:<br /><br />1. Stay away from sugar 🍰🍫🍦🍭<br />2. Stay away from grains 🍪🍕🍞🍔<br /><br />The rules are simple to follow but you need to follow them strictly.<br /><br />So start doing the workout everyday for a week and update me in the comments with what result you are getting!<br /><br />Make sure to also subscribe to the channel to receive new video workouts regularly: everyday Monday to Friday!<br /><br />Good luck and let's begin the challenge!!!💪❤️{% endraw %}
