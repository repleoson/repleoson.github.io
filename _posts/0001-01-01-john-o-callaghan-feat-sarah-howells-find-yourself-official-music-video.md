As the first single of the album, 'Find Yourself' gave a perfect start to everything else John has in stores for us in 2009. This big room anthem has now been released with an official music video.<br /><br />Themed with a retro comic strip feel, the music video of 'Find Yourself' introduces us to our white-dressed hero, alone in his bedroom. As he loses himself in fantasy, he wonders off to the peaceful surroundings of the forest. In the same forest his heroic senses are being tested , as a beautiful girl is attacked by Mr. Black. Want to find out if our hero finds the power within himself and saves the day?<br /><br />Directed by Hugo Keijzer (Corrino Media Group)<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://itunes.com/armadamusic">http://itunes.com/armadamusic</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://armadamusicradio.com">http://armadamusicradio.com</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/armadamusic">https://soundcloud.com/armadamusic</a>{% endraw %}
