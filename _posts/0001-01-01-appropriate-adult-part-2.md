{% raw %}This two-part miniseries, based on actual events, tells the story of Gloucester housewife Janet Leach, who played an important role in uncovering the crimes of Fred and Rosemary West, who murdered a number of people and hid the victims' bodies. The drama centres on the time between Fred West's arrest, his 1995 suicide and the conviction of Rosemary West. It also shows how Fred confided in Leach during his police interviews, when Leach took on the role of the `appropriate adult', a volunteer who sits in on police interviews with vulnerable adults to help safeguard their rights.{% endraw %}
