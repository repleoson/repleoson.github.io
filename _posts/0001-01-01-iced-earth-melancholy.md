{% raw %}Song:Melancholy<br /><br />Artist:Iced Earth<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Make the sadness go away<br /><br />Come back another day<br /><br />For years I've tried to teach<br /><br />But their eyes are empty<br /><br />Empty, too, I have become<br /><br />For them I must die<br /><br />A sad and troubled race<br /><br />An ungrateful troubled place<br /><br /><br /><br />I see the sadness in their eyes<br /><br />Melancholy in their cries<br /><br />Devoid of all the passion<br /><br />The human spirit cannot die<br /><br />Look at the pain around me<br /><br />This is what I cry for<br /><br />Look at the pain around me<br /><br />This is what I'll die for<br /><br /><br /><br />Make the sadness go away<br /><br />Come back another day<br /><br />The things I've said and done<br /><br />Don't matter to anyone<br /><br />But still, you push me to see<br /><br />something I can never be<br /><br />Why am I their shattered king<br /><br />I don't mean anything<br /><br /><br /><br />I see the sadness in their eyes<br /><br />Melancholy in their cries<br /><br />Devoid of all the passion<br /><br />The human spirit cannot die<br /><br />Look at the pain around me<br /><br />This is what I cry for<br /><br />Look at the pain around me<br /><br />This is what I'll die for{% endraw %}
