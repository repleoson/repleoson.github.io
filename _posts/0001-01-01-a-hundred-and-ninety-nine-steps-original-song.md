{% raw %}Lyrics:<br />In every morning when the sparrow sings to the sunrise<br />In every shoreline sculpted by the ebbing tides<br />There you are, <br />There you are.<br /><br />In every storm cloud that cast a shadow in the valley<br />In every river that hums towards the sea<br />There you are,<br />There you are.<br /><br />I will walk, I will climb,<br />A hundred and ninety-nine steps<br />to your glorious heights<br /><br />I will stand, in your wonders,<br />I see you.<br /><br />In every evening when the lights go on the city<br />The sound of laughter fills the living rooms<br />There you are, you find me<br />There you are, you find me.<br /><br />A song me and Talei wrote.<br />The recording is a bit raw cos it was more so we don't forget it than a performance. Though I really like the song, well liked it enough to set it to pictures.{% endraw %}
