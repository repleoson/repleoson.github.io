{% raw %}This short, entertaining business video delivered by <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chunkofchange.com">https://chunkofchange.com</a> business author, marketing expert and speaker Olga Mizrahi will get you understanding how to use UVP as the basis of all your business communication.

Therefore, it is paramount that  the firm communicates the *unique* part of the UVP, answering the &quot;Why should they choose you?&quot; and  &quot;What makes you different?&quot; questions that are the most overlooked part of any business transaction. Basically: Why Choose YOU???{% endraw %}
