{% raw %}Assistant Minister to the Attorney-General Amanda Stoker says she is a big supporter of the lyric change in Australia’s national anthem as it is a sensible and important thing to do.<br /><br />It comes after Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the second line of Advance Australia Fair will be changed from Friday January 1.<br /><br />The line &quot;for we are young and free&quot; will be replaced by &quot;one and free&quot;, in an attempt to recognise Indigenous history.<br /><br />“I think – as a conservative person – sensible, incremental change that reflects the importance of our culture and institutions in bringing us together as one for the long term, for the project that is building a strong Australia that is united and prosperous, this is a sensible but important thing to do,” Ms Stoker told Sky News host Catherine McGregor.<br /><br />“You can’t please everybody of course, and everyone’s entitled to their different points of view, but this I a recognition that we are one Australia.”{% endraw %}
