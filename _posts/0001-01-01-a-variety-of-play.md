{% raw %}A video of some different play sessions between rescued chimpanzees at Chimpanzee Sanctuary Northwest.<br /><br />Note: go to the blog or website to communicate with the sanctuary! We turned off commenting on our YouTube videos. Foxie Chimpanzee loves troll dolls, but her human caregivers don't love internet trolls.<br /><br />Chimpanzee Sanctuary Northwest is against the use of chimpanzees in the entertainment, pet, and biomedical industries. We do not believe chimpanzees belong in captivity. The reality is that there are many chimpanzees in captivity who could never live a life in the wild. We, along with other accredited, true sanctuaries, provide a home for these chimpanzees and allow their individual personalities to shine. Learn more about the chimpanzees, the sanctuary, and our philosophy on our website and daily blog.  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/chimpsnw">https://linktr.ee/chimpsnw</a>  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ChimpsNW.org">https://ChimpsNW.org</a>{% endraw %}
