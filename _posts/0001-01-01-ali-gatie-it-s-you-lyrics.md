I know how it feels<br />To be open<br />And then find out your love isn't real.<br />I'm still hurting.<br />Yeah. I'm hurting inside.<br />I'm so scared to fall in love,<br />But if it's you then I'll try.<br /><br />It's you, it's always you.<br />If I'm ever gonna fall in love I know it's gon' be you.<br />It's you, it's always you.<br />Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you.<br /><br />So, please, don't break my heart.<br />Don't tear me apart.<br />I know how it starts.<br />Trust me: I've been broken before.<br />Don't break me again.<br />I am delicate.<br />Please, don't break my heart.<br />Trust me: I've been broken before.<br /><br />I know I'm not the best at choosing lovers.<br />We both know my past speaks for itself.<br />For itself.<br />If you don't think that we're right for each other<br />(Baby, no.)<br />Then, please, don't let history repeat itself.<br /><br />'Cause I want you. Yeah. I want you. Yeah.<br />There's nothing else I want.<br />'Cause I want you. Yeah. I want you. Yeah.<br />And you're the only thing I want.<br /><br />It's you, it's always you.<br />If I'm ever gonna fall in love I know it's gon' be you.<br />It's you, it's always you.<br />Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you.<br /><br />So, please, don't break my heart.<br />Don't tear me apart.<br />I know how it starts.<br />Trust me: I've been broken before.<br />Don't break me again.<br />I am delicate.<br />Please, don't break my heart.<br />Trust me: I've been broken before.<br /><br />'Cause I want you, baby.
