{% raw %}If your wife and your mother are having conflict, the real battle is to get on the same page with your wife first. Mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationships can be a challenge. Try these five life hacks.<br /><br /><br />Discussion Questions:<br />1. Listen to your wife. In your own words, describe the main problem she's having with your mother.<br />2. What are some boundaries you need to draw for the sake of your wife and your marriage? Make a list.<br />3. Ask your wife what she needs from you. How can you serve her and honor her? <br />4. Do you think your wife is feeling insecure about her relationship with your mom or dad? Does she feel secure in her love for you? Talk about it.<br />5. Do you think it's time to talk to your mother about this issue? If not, when would be a better time? Are you willing to go, as the man, and represent both you and your wife?<br /><br />If you liked this video, please subscribe to our YouTube channel. <br /><br />--<br /><br />PursueGOD Men is the official men's channel for pursueGOD.org, a free online discipleship resource for families, small groups, and individual mentoring relationships. <br /><br />Find us online:<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pursueGOD.org">http://www.pursueGOD.org</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pursueGODvideo">https://www.facebook.com/pursueGODvideo</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/pursueGODorg">https://twitter.com/pursueGODorg</a><br />Google + Community: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/communities/1...">https://plus.google.com/communities/1...</a><br /><br />For more resources for families, small groups, and churches visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pursueGOD.org">http://www.pursueGOD.org</a><br /><br />Unless otherwise noted, Bible verses are taken from the NLT.<br />Scripture quotations marked (NLT) are taken from the Holy Bible, New Living Translation, copyright Â© 1996, 2004, 2007 by Tyndale House Foundation.
