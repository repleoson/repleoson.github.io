{% raw %}A BBC News Arabic investigation has uncovered systemic child abuse inside Islamic schools in Sudan, with boys as young as five years old routinely chained, shackled and beaten by the “sheikhs”, or religious men in charge of the schools. The investigation also found evidence of sexual abuse. For 18 months, reporter, Fateh Al-Rahman Al-Hamdani, filmed inside 23 schools across Sudan. He found boys shackled and chained and witnessed brutal routine beatings.<br /><br />***<br /><br />UPDATE: This #BBCAfricaEye and #BBCArabic investigation won the #Amnesty Media Award 2021 for Best Investigation. <br /><br />****<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/subscribetoafrica">http://bit.ly/subscribetoafrica</a><br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/africa">https://www.bbc.com/africa</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcnewsafrica/">https://www.facebook.com/bbcnewsafrica/</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/bbcafrica/">https://www.twitter.com/bbcafrica/</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcafrica/">https://www.instagram.com/bbcafrica/</a>{% endraw %}
