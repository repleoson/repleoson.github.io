{% raw %}God did not create you to be common. We are living in a day where the standards are being lowered, where it’s acceptable to compromise, take the easy way out, and have no integrity. If we’re not careful, we’ll adapt to our environment and become like everyone else. This way of living can limit what God wants to do in our lives.<br /><br />Paul said in Romans 12:2, “Don’t let society squeeze you into its mold.” <br /><br />Learn why it’s important to live with integrity and excellence. When you make the decision to be uncommon, to not fit in and do what everyone else is doing, then you will see uncommon favor, strength, friendships and increase! You will become everything God created you to be!<br /><br />This is message #760, &quot;Uncommon&quot;, by Joel Osteen.
