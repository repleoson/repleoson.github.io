{% raw %}In this video we talk about &quot;maybe&quot; and &quot;may be&quot; so you can understand the difference between &quot;Maybe&quot; and &quot;May Be&quot;. <br /><br />&quot;maybe&quot; and &quot;may be&quot; have the same meaning. They're both used to talk about the possibility of something happening or being true. <br /><br />However, &quot;maybe&quot; and &quot;may be&quot; are used differently in speech. If you use one instead of the other, your sentence will be incorrect. <br /><br />This is because &quot;maybe&quot; is an adverb and &quot;may&quot; is a verb. It's commonly used with the base verb &quot;be&quot;, which gives you &quot;may be&quot;. <br /><br />Because &quot;maybe&quot; is an adverb and &quot;may be&quot; is a verb, they are used differently in sentences. <br /><br />&quot;maybe&quot; generally comes at the very beginning of a sentence, whereas &quot;may be&quot; comes after the subject. <br /><br />In this video, you'll get real comfortable with the difference between &quot;maybe&quot; and &quot;may be&quot; so you can improve your advanced English grammar and feel confident speaking English in public.<br /><br />Please subscribe for more videos to help you learn English and sound like a native English speaker!  <br /><br /><br /><br />Let’s Connect: <br /><br /><br /><br />Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/JForrestEnglish">https://www.facebook.com/JForrestEnglish</a> <br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JForrestEnglish">https://twitter.com/JForrestEnglish</a><br /><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-forrest">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-forrest</a><br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.jforrestenglish.com/">http://www.jforrestenglish.com/</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />Free Guide – Speak English Fluently &amp; Confidently in 6 Easy Steps.
