The Seventh is a stripped back and dry tool, with â€žMr. A.' giving one of the most sinister vocals you'll have heard since a while. Andre Crom takes the vocals of The Seventh and injects a heavy dose of energy, creating a peaktime bomb. Syntax Error offers a strong groove topped by a relentless synth line to create a real dancefloor weapon. On God Speed, Mr. A features on another a dry and percussive tool.{% endraw %}
