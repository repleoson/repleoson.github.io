{% raw %}Shawn kicks off the 167 series with an honest and vulnerable update on his battle with anxiety and the lessons he’s learned about the “necessary endings” we all encounter in our lives. Shawn’s message highlights some of the biggest lessons he’s learned during his time in therapy, and focuses on how we can work through our own individual struggles. This message is truly one of Shawn’s finest, and it can deeply impact each of us as we work through our past pain and trauma, as we allow God to heal old wounds, and as we accept God’s love for us even in our lowest seasons.{% endraw %}
