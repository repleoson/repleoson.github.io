{% raw %}Isaac Asimov’s Foundation Series was the first-ever science fiction series to contain a full-fledged galactic empire. The entire series involves the centuries-long plan of a man known as Hari Seldon, to restore the human galactic empire after a great crash that led to a dark age. Hari Seldon was able to predict the fall of the first galactic empire by use of a form of mathematics known as psychohistory, which was able to predict human behavior overtime at mass. <br /><br />Essentially the empire fell due to the capital planet, Trantor's inability to adequately handle the bureaucratic and administrative demands of such a large empire, containing 25 Million worlds. Hari Seldon’s Solution would ultimately prove to be extremely complicated and multifaceted, but it is presented initially as the creation of the Foundation. The Foundation would be founded on the distant world of Terminus and would have an encyclopedist whose job was to record all human knowledge in the universe inside the Encyclopedia Galactica. Thousands of humans would devote themselves to the project in an effort to preserve the knowledge of all mankind in the hope that doing so they could shorten the interregnum which would follow the collapse of the empire.<br /><br />MY GRAPHIC NOVEL IS ON SALE NOW!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tadhya-graphic-novel/x/22779913?create_edit=true#/">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tadhya-graphic-novel/x/22779913?create_edit=true#/</a><br /><br />Quinn's Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.quinnhoward.net">https://www.quinnhoward.net</a><br /><br />Hyperion Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRXGGVBzHLUfgKLf-CBr5VCC2xM0qX8Xh">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRXGGVBzHLUfgKLf-CBr5VCC2xM0qX8Xh</a><br />Dune Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRXGGVBzHLUdsgN_vFaZmfjc6bXxPqajV">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRXGGVBzHLUdsgN_vFaZmfjc6bXxPqajV</a><br />Foundation Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRXGGVBzHLUeQMsBkZJ72aIIG8nR-No6J">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRXGGVBzHLUeQMsBkZJ72aIIG8nR-No6J</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />Please consider supporting this channel on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/ideasoficeandfire">https://www.patreon.com/ideasoficeandfire</a><br />or PAYPAL - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/QuinnsIdeas?locale.x=en_US">https://paypal.me/QuinnsIdeas?locale.x=en_US</a><br /><br />I NOW HAVE A SUBREDDIT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IdeasofIceandFire/">https://www.reddit.com/r/IdeasofIceandFire/</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/IDEASOFICE_FIRE">https://twitter.com/IDEASOFICE_FIRE</a><br /><br />Like me on Facebook!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/IOIAF">https://www.facebook.com/IOIAF</a><br /><br />Feel free to leave a comment like and subscribe!<br /><br />Thanks For Watching!{% endraw %}
