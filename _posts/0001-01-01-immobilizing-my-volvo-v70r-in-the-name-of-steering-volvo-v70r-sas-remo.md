{% raw %}Just because the car has been running fine, doesn't mean the car is all fixed...<br /><br />Today, I address one of this car's biggest issues.  The steering angle sensor.  Apparently, the steering angle sensor (SAS) ties together several different modules on the Volvo V70R, and if it works... 3 other modules should work properly.  I have my buddy Jacob in town to help me, and the folks at @XeMODeX Inc have been helping me throughout the entire process.... This should be great!<br /><br />I also get the opportunity to install windshield wipers and the hatch struts!  A lot happens!<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />Follow me on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/alvis.elliott/">https://www.instagram.com/alvis.elliott/</a><br /><br />‘Like’ me on Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ElliottAlvisCars/">https://www.facebook.com/ElliottAlvisCars/</a><br /><br />Join my Facebook Group:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/223675089007451">https://www.facebook.com/groups/223675089007451</a><br /><br /><br />#Volvo #V70R #Wagon{% endraw %}
