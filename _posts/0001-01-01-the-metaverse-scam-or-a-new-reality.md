{% raw %}Metaverse, the very word itself invokes images of cyberpunk neon drenched technology.  Matrix like constructed realities.  Future cities with a potential technical singularity right around the cornerâ€¦<br /><br />The concept of a metaverse is a few decades old at this point, and like many things, finds its origins primarily in fiction with the novel Snow Crash from 1992, although some feel there might be earlier references.  In recent years however, the term has been increasingly used throughout both mainstream media, as well as by numerous tech giants.<br /><br />Thanks to Cervidian and StuartGT for the help with editing the script.<br /><br /><br />If you would like to help support my channel, please check my Patreon page:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/obsidianant">https://www.patreon.com/obsidianant</a><br />PayPal Donation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=H5LJ5URGUB7ZQ">https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=H5LJ5URGUB7ZQ</a><br />Any support is massively appreciated!<br /><br /><br />GamesIndustry.biz<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-08-20-what-is-the-metaverse-and-why-is-it-worth-so-much-money">https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-08-20-what-is-the-metaverse-and-why-is-it-worth-so-much-money</a><br /><br />Medium.com<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://medium.com/building-the-metaverse/market-map-of-the-metaverse-8ae0cde89696">https://medium.com/building-the-metaverse/market-map-of-the-metaverse-8ae0cde89696</a><br /><br />Gabe Newell<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/gabe-newell-brain-computer-interfaces-way-closer-matrix-people-realize/">https://www.roadtovr.com/gabe-newell-brain-computer-interfaces-way-closer-matrix-people-realize/</a><br /><br />Upper Echelon Gamers<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35AZltVAuX4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35AZltVAuX4</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Music<br />Epidemic Sound<br />Star Citizen section - Music from Star Citizen<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />#Metaverse{% endraw %}
