{% raw %}I wrote this worship song with a few of my friends from Victory Worshipâ€‹ :) Inviting all of you this Saturday, November 25, 6PM at the Ynares Sports Arena in Pasig to come end the year with Thanksgiving through worship. I will be leading with @upperroomworshipMNL. Tickets are available at the door. You may also contact 09273518946 for more details. See you there! <br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Under Your grace, Your mercy amazes me<br />Under Your wing, Your shadow covers me<br />Your promise of love where my heart is safely undone<br /><br />Speak to me, Lord, Your servant is listening<br />Over the noise, I hear You whispering<br />My hope has come and my heart is safely undone <br /><br />*<br />I've found my fortress in You<br />And my soul is anchored with You<br />My resting place is in Your name <br />Forever safe <br /><br />You are never far away<br />Always reaching out to save<br />My weakness covered by Your strength<br />And I am found forever safe <br /><br />*** This song is now out on iTunes &amp; Spotify under Victory Worship sung by Isa Fabregas :){% endraw %}
