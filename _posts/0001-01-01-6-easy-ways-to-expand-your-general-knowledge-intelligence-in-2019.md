Unsplash for images :)<br />--<br /><br />Hey! My name's Keshav Bhatt and I'm on a mission to help more people find, follow &amp; live their purpose. Why live in what you hate? Or don't even enjoy that much? On this channel, everyday I share free motivational &amp; personal development videos that help you develop yourself in different areas. I have 4 diplomas in professional coaching, am a licensed &amp; accredited NLP practitioner, and worked with thousands of people in the last 6 years globally. You can find more about my story &amp; my work on my website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://keshavbhatt.com">https://keshavbhatt.com</a> <br /><br />Outside of YouTube, I'm also currently the CEO of Revolution Hive - a grassroots social enterprise working to change the education system in the UK. We go into schools, colleges, universities teaching young people (often from the most disadvantaged backgrounds) the life lessons they don't always get to learn in curriculum. <br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to read this.<br /><br />(last updated: March 2019)<br /><br />#generalknowledge #getsmarter #tips{% endraw %}
