Hey! Hey!<br /><br />[Verse 1: Nanna, Ragnar &amp; Both]<br />I don't like walking around this old and empty house<br />So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear<br />The stairs creak as you sleep; it's keeping me awake<br />It's the house telling you to close your eyes<br />Some days I can't even dress myself<br />It's killing me to see you this way<br />'Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our<br />Bodies safe to shore<br /><br />[Refrain: Nanna, Ragnar]<br />Hey!<br />Hey!<br />Hey!<br /><br />[Verse 2: Nanna, Ragnar &amp; Both]<br />There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back<br />Well, tell her that I miss our little talks<br />Soon it will be over and buried with our past<br />We used to play outside when we were young, and full of life and full of love<br />Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right<br />Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear<br />'Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our<br />Bodies safe to shore<br /><br />[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]<br />Hey! Don't listen to a word I say<br />Hey! The screams all sound the same<br />Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our<br />Bodies safe to shore<br /><br />[Refrain: Nanna, Ragnar]<br />Hey!<br />Hey!<br />Hey!<br /><br />[Bridge: Nanna, Ragnar]<br />You're gone, gone, gone away; I watched you disappear<br />All that's left is a ghost of you<br />Now we're torn, torn, torn apart; there's nothing we can do<br />Just let me go, we'll meet again soon<br />Now wait, wait, wait for me; please hang around<br />I'll see you when I fall asleep<br /><br />[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]<br />Hey! Don't listen to a word I say<br />Hey! The screams all sound the same<br />Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our<br />Bodies safe to shore<br /><br />[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]<br />Hey! Don't listen to a word I say<br />Hey! The screams all sound the same<br />Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our<br />Bodies safe to shore<br /><br />[Outro: Nanna, Ragnar]<br />Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our<br />Bodies safe to shore<br /><br />.........<br />📷 Wallpaper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unsplash.com/">https://unsplash.com/</a><br />.........<br />📧 Contact / Demo Submissions: contact@7clouds.org<br />.........<br />💌 Demos / Music Submissions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com">https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com</a><br />.........<br /><br />#OfMonstersAndMen #LittleTalks #Lyrics{% endraw %}
