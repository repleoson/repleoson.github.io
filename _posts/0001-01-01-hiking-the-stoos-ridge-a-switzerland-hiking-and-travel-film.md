{% raw %}This video has subtitles for the talky parts :) So... Switzerland 2! Guten Tag everybody. I hope you're all doing well and that you agree with me that this is one of the most beautiful spots on Earth!<br /><br />I had a lav mic on for the end part, but it didn't work for some reason, so it's only camera audio... I hope you can hear it, otherwise I've put subtitles / closed captions that you can switch on on the video player. And I will try my best to avoid tech problems in the future :)<br /><br />Thanks so much for the reaction to Switzerland 1. Love ya<br /><br />This is me hiking the Stoos ridge, which is probably the best day hike from Zurich, or even the best day trip from Zurich. I got the bus to the Schwyz Stoosbahn and went up the Stoos furnicular, before riding the chairlift up to the start of the Stoos ridge hike. I hope you enjoy this hiking film and travel guide :)<br /><br />Follow me on insta <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tomth0rnton/">https://www.instagram.com/tomth0rnton/</a><br /><br />Camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3bGGrb2">https://amzn.to/3bGGrb2</a><br />Microphone I use at home: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MtTGTF">https://amzn.to/2MtTGTF</a><br />My 40L travel backpack: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3b3Ywkh">https://amzn.to/3b3Ywkh</a><br />SSD I edit from: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3syP7He">https://amzn.to/3syP7He</a>{% endraw %}
