{% raw %}Architect and co-founder of H+A explains why refurbishment needs to follow a natural cycle, and at the same time, architects and designers need to design keeping longevity in mind. <br /><br />He also discusses why adaptive reuse movement in the UAE has not been fully embraced yet, its environmental impact and the need to create an awareness about preserving the past heritage. <br /><br />Lessard also addresses some of the challenges faced by architects and designers in the region. He notes that creative ideas should be valued more, not just in terms of financial rewards but also as a celebration of innovation and ingenuity. <br /><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2RmUerQ">https://bit.ly/2RmUerQ</a><br />READ MORE ON OUR WEBSITE: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2xhqpko">https://bit.ly/2xhqpko</a><br />FIND US ON TWITTER: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/comm_int_design">https://twitter.com/comm_int_design</a><br />FOLLOW US ON INSTAGRAM: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/commercial_interior_design">https://www.instagram.com/commercial_interior_design</a><br />FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CommercialInteriorDesign/">https://www.facebook.com/CommercialInteriorDesign/</a>{% endraw %}
