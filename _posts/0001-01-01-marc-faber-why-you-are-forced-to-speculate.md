{% raw %}For the latest Marc Faber, go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://MarcFaberBlog.com">http://MarcFaberBlog.com</a> - <br /><br />We have a President in the White House who seems to know everything. He has supposed solutions in every aspect of life. It is impossible to know everything that there is to make a good decision in economics, so how can Mr. Obama even come close to making an intelligent decision. Going forward, after the strong rally in equities that we have had, we will probably enter a resting period. If equity prices go down, then we will have another stimulus. The weaker that the economy becomes, the more stimulus we will have, which will make the economy even weaker. The government will force people to speculate. With interest rates at zero and in an inflationary environment, people will be forced to speculate in order to earn a return at all.{% endraw %}
