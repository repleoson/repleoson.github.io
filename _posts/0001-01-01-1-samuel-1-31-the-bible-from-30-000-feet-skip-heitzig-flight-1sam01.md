{% raw %}In this flight, we find the nation of Israel in desperate need of direction and leadership. We will meet the man whose good looks, physical stature, and success in war made him an obvious choice from a human perspective, but Israel's first king had a tragic flaw: pride. From the ashes of King Saul's calamitous reign, God raised up an unlikely man who would become Israel's next king, a man after His own heart.<br /><br />This teaching is from our series The Bible from 30,000 Feet - 2018 with Skip Heitzig from Calvary Church.{% endraw %}
