Sultan is a classic underdog tale about a wrestler's journey, looking for a comeback by defeating all odds staked up against him. But when he has nothing to lose and everything to gain in this fight for his life matchâ€¦ Sultan must literally fight for his life.<br /><br />Sultan believes heâ€™s got what it takesâ€¦ but this time, itâ€™s going to take everything heâ€™s got.<br /><br />&quot;Wrestling is not a sport it's about fighting what lies within&quot;â€¦..
