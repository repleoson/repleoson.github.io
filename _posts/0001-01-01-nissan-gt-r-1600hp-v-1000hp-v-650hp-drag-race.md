It’s had an engine rebuild so you’ll now find a 4.1-litre V6 under the bonnet which produces an astronomic 1,600hp &amp; 1630Nm of torque!! All-in-all,  around £100,000 was spent on these upgrades. <br /><br />Alongside him, we have a GT-R that’s had £35,000 of upgrades added to it. These include adding hybrid turbos and strengthening the gearbox, and as a result, the car now kicks out 1,000hp &amp; 1,150Nm. <br /><br />Then finally we have the most basic car here. It’s had an ECU remap, along with new intakes &amp; exhausts added to it. Thanks to that, it now puts down 650hp (100hp more than the standard car) along with 840Nm. <br /><br />So the result may be a foregone conclusion, but will the 1,600hp GT-R prove its worth?! There’s only one way to find out… LET’S RACE!<br /><br />.............................................................<br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/carwow">http://www.instagram.com/carwow</a><br /><br />Tiktok - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow">https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow</a><br /><br />Facebook – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk">http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk</a><br /><br />Twitter – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk">http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk</a><br /><br />Sign Up to our Newsletter – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/carwow-Newsletter">http://bit.ly/carwow-Newsletter</a><br /><br />Awkward haggling is a thing of the past with carwow.
