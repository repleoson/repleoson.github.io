They travel the ends of the earth searching for a new perspective on life. In their five-year journey across six continents, they live with some of the oldest indigenous communities on the planet. They gain access to tribal sages never filmed or interviewed before, without a crew or schedule, just one backpack and one camera each. And the curiosity to listen.  <br /><br />They meet the most humble yet charismatic people; unknown individuals who live under the radar of our modern society in connection with the natural world. The film reveals the deep wisdom the family discover in their conversations with these 'Earth Keepers' and its power to transform lives.  Having lived in hiding for centuries, the Earth Keepers see that now is the time to step forward and share their insights with those who are ready to listen.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.downtoearthfilm.com">http://www.downtoearthfilm.com</a>{% endraw %}
