Foxes - Clarity<br /><br />High dive into frozen waves where the past comes back to life<br />Fight fear for the selfish pain, it was worth it every time<br />Hold still right before we crash 'cause we both know how this ends<br />A clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass and I drown in you again<br /><br />'Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need<br />Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why<br /><br />If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?<br />If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?<br /><br />(Hey-ay, hey-ay-ay. Hey-ay, hey-ay-ay. Hey-ay, hey-ay-ay. Hey-ay, hey)<br /><br />If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?<br />If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?<br /><br />Walk on through a red parade and refuse to make amends<br />It cuts deep through our ground and makes us forget all common sense<br />Don't speak as I try to leave 'cause we both know what we'll choose<br />If you pull then I'll push too deep and I'll fall right back to you<br /><br />'Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need<br />Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why<br /><br />If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?<br />If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?<br /><br />(Hey-ay, hey-ay-ay. Hey-ay, hey-ay-ay. Hey-ay, hey-ay-ay. Hey-ay, hey)<br /><br />Why are you my clarity?<br />Why are you my remedy?<br />Why are you my clarity?<br />Why are you my remedy?<br /><br />If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?<br />If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?<br /><br />#Zedd #Foxes #Clarity #Awelyrics #lyrics #zeddclarity #zeddclaritylyrics #foxesclarity #foxesclaritylyrics #zeddfoxesclarity #music #songs{% endraw %}
