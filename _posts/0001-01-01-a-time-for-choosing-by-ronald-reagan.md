{% raw %}&quot;The Speech&quot; is what Ronald Reagan called it. Today we call it, &quot;A Time for Choosing,&quot; and it was a pivotal turning point in Ronald Reagan's life.<br /><br />Ronald Reagan began a long side-career of public speaking as his acting career closed out. He traveled across the country meeting Lions Clubs, Rotary Clubs, Chambers of Commerce and any other civic-minded local groups. This continued and intensified during his service as the General Electric spokesperson while hosting their sponsored television series. &quot;The Speech&quot; was delivered in various forms and to different audiences as each word was honed, measured and memorized.<br />During the 1964 Presidential campaign, Republican party officials in California, who knew Reagan's powerful message and delivery, asked him to film a speech on behalf of the Republican candidate, Barry Goldwater. The speech was aired on October 27, 1964 and it was electrifying. Donations to the Republican party and candidates increased dramatically.<br /><br />The Republican Party took note and they targeted Reagan as a candidate from that point forward. He agreed in 1966 to run for Governor of California. He won two terms, and eventually won the Presidency.<br /><br />Table of Contents:<br />0:00 Choose My Own Words<br />1:42 We Haven't Balanced Our Budget<br />2:14 As For The Peace That We Would Preserve...<br />3:28 Government is Beholden to The People<br />6:22 Government's Involvement In The Farm Economy<br />8:26 The Assault on Freedom Carries On<br />10:18 The Need Grows Greater; the Program Grows Greater<br />12:37 What Are We Doing to Those We Seek to Help?<br />15:14 Barry Goldwater Thinks We Can<br />17:50 No Government Ever Voluntarily Reduces Itself<br />20:47 Democratic Opponents Seem Unwilling to Debate<br />23:55 Perhaps There Is a Simple Answer<br />27:17 You And I Have a Rendezvous With Destiny <br /><br />Watch a special &quot;Remembering A Time For Choosing&quot; video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulQ7kJIhZqg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulQ7kJIhZqg</a><br /><br />For more information on the ongoing works of President Reagan's Foundation, please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.reaganfoundation.org">http://www.reaganfoundation.org</a><br /><br />For more information on donations, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reaganfoundation.org/support-us">https://www.reaganfoundation.org/support-us</a><br /><br />Like us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/RonaldReagan">https://www.facebook.com/RonaldReagan</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ronaldreagan">https://twitter.com/ronaldreagan</a> <br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://http://instagram.com/reaganfoundation">https://http://instagram.com/reaganfoundation</a><br />Follow us on LinkedIn:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ronald-reagan-presidential-library-foundation">https://www.linkedin.com/company/ronald-reagan-presidential-library-foundation</a><br />Newsletter Sign-up: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reaganfoundation.org/newsletter">https://www.reaganfoundation.org/newsletter</a>{% endraw %}
