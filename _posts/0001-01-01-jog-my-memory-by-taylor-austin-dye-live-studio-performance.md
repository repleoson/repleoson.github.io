{% raw %}Live studio performance of Taylor Austin Dye's original song &quot;Jog My Memory.&quot; <br />Percussion by Ben Williamson <br />Co-written with Steve Grauberger. <br />Studio 74 (Marshall Bastin) <br /><br />JOG MY MEMORY<br /><br />I know it’s been quite a while<br />But sometimes the thought of you and me <br />The way we used to be <br />still makes me smile <br />I know that we’ve both moved on<br />But somehow you’ve got a part <br />Deep inside my heart <br />That still lingers on <br /><br />Dreaming of a love lost in time<br />I must be out of my mind<br /><br />Jog my memory <br />Run it down <br />So when the thought of you comes creeping back around<br />Jog my memory <br />So I’ll walk on by <br />And I’ll remember all the reasons I said goodbye<br />It’ll come back to me<br />Why you’re no good for me<br />Jog my memory<br /><br />Sometimes I hold my own<br />I remember all the times you didn’t walk the line <br />And all you did wrong <br />But Sometimes I need to hear your voice <br />To be the reminder that I need of all your dirty deeds <br />and why I made the choice<br /><br />To cut you right out of my life<br />Since the scars have all healed from your knife<br /><br />Maybe now I wont forget <br />That loving you leads to regret <br /><br />Jog my memory <br />Run it down <br />So when the thought of you comes creeping back around<br />Jog my memory <br />So I’ll walk on by <br />And I’ll remember all the reasons I said goodbye<br />It’ll come back to me<br />Why you’re no good for me<br />Jog my memory{% endraw %}
