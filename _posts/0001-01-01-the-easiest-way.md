{% raw %}MY PUBLIC FACEBOOK PAGE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/frankpiekert">https://www.facebook.com/frankpiekert</a><br />This is my own little &quot;Ho'oponopono-song&quot;. I borrowed the title of the song from Mabel Katz book of the same name.  <br />Ho'oponopono is an ancient Hawaiian technique for solving problems. This song is about Self Identity through Ho'oponopono (SITH) which is an updated Ho'oponopono approach, a process of repentance, forgiveness and transmutation developed by Kahuna Lapa'au Morrnah Nalamaku Simeona.<br />Dr. Ihaleakala Hew Len often asks: &quot;Have you ever noticed that whenever you have a problem, you are there?&quot;  I think it´s brilliant!!! <br />&quot;Life is the dancer and you are the dance&quot; is a quote from Eckhart Tolle´s book:  A New Earth.<br />The painting I FORGIVE MYSELF is painted by Veronika Wifvesson.<br />Produced by Amir Aly at Yla Studios.<br /><br />If you want to know more about The Easiest Way go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://theeasiestway.com/">http://theeasiestway.com/</a>{% endraw %}
