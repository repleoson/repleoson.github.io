If you want to learn how to sell more and how to close more sales you must narrow down the options you give. All too often salespeople create their own sales sabotage by offering too many choices. When you use psychology in sales the right way you can close more deals. This is one of the old school sales techniques that does work for the long term. There are good closing techniques in sales that do work and are not cheesy.
