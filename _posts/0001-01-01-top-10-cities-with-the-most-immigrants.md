{% raw %}Top 10 Cities with the Most Immigrants.<br /><br /> I get questions about demographics all the time. Most are just curious about where to live. They would like to know what they might be looking at if they move to someplace. <br />  We have other comments and a few emails from people with bad information. A few comments have suggested it is a fact that Los Angeles is 90% immigrants. Not even close. <br />  But, most of those people that leave comments like that believe various cities around the united states have between 70 and 90% foreign-born populations. Here’s the thing, only 1 city in the United States is over 70%. <br /><br /><br /><br />World According to Briggs website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.worldaccordingtobriggs.com/">https://www.worldaccordingtobriggs.com/</a><br /><br />🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹<br /> 🔶My Other Channels: <br />    🟥  On This Day  <br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs9MGJ6xVKLKG_YsQkQNLjg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs9MGJ6xVKLKG_YsQkQNLjg</a><br />    🟥     According To Briggs <br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBkk4NYCe6f7sW4TU6_YO-w">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBkk4NYCe6f7sW4TU6_YO-w</a><br /><br /> <br />  The camera I use and you should too if you have kids, grandkids, pets, you like to hike, or do anything else that includes moving and filming: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3gSVT7x">https://amzn.to/3gSVT7x</a><br />It is small and easy to use. <br /><br />#UnitedStates<br /> #Immigration<br /><br /><br /><br />❤Things You should watch or listen to:<br />    Hermens Outdoors:<br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgEIwkmBTuhy6Djx6XipM3g">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgEIwkmBTuhy6Djx6XipM3g</a><br />    Caffeinated Humor Podcast:<br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://anchor.fm/caffeinatedhumor">https://anchor.fm/caffeinatedhumor</a><br />    Kimmie the Explorer:<br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF88qxZPdAfeBVDR2WOjVyg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF88qxZPdAfeBVDR2WOjVyg</a><br /><br />Business &amp; Voice over email: World2Briggs@gmail.com<br /><br />Mailing Address:   World According to Briggs<br />                                 20449 SW Tualatin Valley Hwy<br />                                 # 354<br />                                 Aloha, Oregon 97003{% endraw %}
