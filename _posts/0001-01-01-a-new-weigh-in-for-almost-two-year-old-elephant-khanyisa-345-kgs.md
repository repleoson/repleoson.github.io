{% raw %}Khanyisa’s weight is going up and up and with only 2 sleeps till her birthday, we are so thrilled to see her now at 345 kgs! Stavros and Herman weigh her while Herman feeds her two morning milk bottles 🍼 <br /><br />After polishing off breakfast, Khanyisa enjoys some happy peaceful garden time close to Lammie and Nungu. Stavros joins to keep her company out in the nursery grounds too and then calls her to head out. With the weather warming up, Khanyisa is more eager to leave the orphanage than on the chilly mornings and she moves steadily out toward her herd with Stavros leading. New herd moments coming in the next video!<br /><br />Nungu and Lammie enjoy head rubs and grassy treats too, as the sun rises beautifully in the background 🌞 💛{% endraw %}
