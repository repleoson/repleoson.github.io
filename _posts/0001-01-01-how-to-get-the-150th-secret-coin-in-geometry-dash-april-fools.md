{% raw %}If you know a lot about Geometry Dash players, you're probably aware that you can only collect up to 149 secret coins on a single profile... right? Well it turns out that a final, 150th coin has been hiding away ever since 2.1 came out over four years ago...<br /><br />Post April Fools blurb:<br />So this is easily one of the highest effort videos I've made in a long time. Almost everything in the video was actually modded into the game and is 100% playable. The whole thing took about a month to plan out and put together, with a team of 6 other people involved. Making this video was an absolute blast from start to finish, and I really hope you enjoyed it! üß°<br /><br />Special thanks to all my friends who made this video possible!<br />Interface edits: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/PoweredByPie">https://twitter.com/PoweredByPie</a><br />Custom dialogue boxes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FigmentBoy_">https://twitter.com/FigmentBoy_</a><br />Daily chest hack + RobTop profile GDPS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheWylieMaster">https://twitter.com/TheWylieMaster</a><br />Pokemon hack + music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mudstepmusic">https://twitter.com/mudstepmusic</a><br />RobTop textbox portraits:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/jyrocopter_">https://twitter.com/jyrocopter_</a><br />Basement Scratch texture: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/LoafeeBuns">https://twitter.com/LoafeeBuns</a><br /><br />Behind the Scenes video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/q9Bu6BZbuQ8">https://youtu.be/q9Bu6BZbuQ8</a><br /><br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />üéÆ Second Channel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/gdsemicolon">https://bit.ly/gdsemicolon</a><br />üê¶ Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheRealGDColon">https://twitter.com/TheRealGDColon</a><br />üíª Website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gdcolon.com">https://gdcolon.com</a><br />ü§ñ Discord Bot - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://robotop.xyz">https://robotop.xyz</a><br /><br />If you're reading this, no human should be forced to complete 65 map packs{% endraw %}
