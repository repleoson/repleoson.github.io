This means doing the code is very important to gaining the experience and skills.<br /><br />I am very much a beginner in programming and coding, this is my experience through this course, I may stumble, fall or even fail, but I will always dust myself off and come back when I am ready after a break, or some rest if needed, this cycle is continuous through life, and I suggest all students understand this and accept it for what it is. <br /><br />Never stop learning.<br /><br />Thank you for your time, I hope you found this video helpful.<br /><br />F3ND1MUS<br /><br />Permission to use the material on FreeCodeCamp.org is created with permission based on public information posted by Quincy Larson of FreeCodeCamp.org, for more information see here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtuberfriendlycompanies.blogspot.com/2020/09/free-code-camporg.html">https://youtuberfriendlycompanies.blogspot.com/2020/09/free-code-camporg.html</a> <br /><br />THANK YOU QUINCY LARSON AND FREE CODE CAMP.ORG TEAM!<br /><br />For more F3ND1MUS information go here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://f3nd1mus.wordpress.com/">https://f3nd1mus.wordpress.com/</a> [RESOLVED/SORT OF] FreeCodeCamp.org not Working with Internet Explorer Microsoft Edge Safari etc <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://f3nd1mustechproblems.blogspot.com/2020/10/resolvedsort-of-freecodecamporg-not.html">https://f3nd1mustechproblems.blogspot.com/2020/10/resolvedsort-of-freecodecamporg-not.html</a>{% endraw %}
