{% raw %}The Oceans are swamped with plastic and famous brands are here to the rescue: Adidas, Coca-Cola, Ocean Cleanup and many more. But how does this work and is this really the way to save our oceans? <br /><br />We're destroying our environment at an alarming rate. But it doesn't need to be this way.
