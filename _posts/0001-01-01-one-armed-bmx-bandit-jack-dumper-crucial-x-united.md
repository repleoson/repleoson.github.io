Jack was born with one arm but has been determined to never let that impede him having fun. We've been watching this guy for a good few years now and his progression is unreal. Enjoy a short but sweet video with Crucial BMX / United rider Jack tearing up his local Campus Skatepark in Bristol. <br /><br />Interview here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://digbmx.com/dig-this/jack-dumper-interview-united-crucial">https://digbmx.com/dig-this/jack-dumper-interview-united-crucial</a><br /><br />Filmed and edited by Emerson Morgan<br /><br />In conjunction with:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.crucialbmxshop.com/">https://www.crucialbmxshop.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unitedbikeco.com/">https://unitedbikeco.com/</a><br /><br /><br />____ <br /><br />Download the DIG BMX APP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://digbmx.com/videos/the-dig-bmx-app">http://digbmx.com/videos/the-dig-bmx-app</a> <br />Visit our website for more BMX videos - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://digbmx.com">http://digbmx.com</a> <br /> ● Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/DIGBMX">http://www.facebook.com/DIGBMX</a> <br /> ● Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/DIGBMX">http://www.instagram.com/DIGBMX</a> <br /> ● Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/DIGBMX">http://www.twitter.com/DIGBMX</a><br /><br />#bmx #digbmx #ukbmx{% endraw %}
