{% raw %}The perfect wedding song. <br /><br />**The correct lyrics in the chorus are: WILL HAVE AND HOLD YOU (sorry, I wrote these by ear)**<br /><br />One of Westlife's unreleased songs - Sung solo by Shane Filan. <br />Leaked in 2010 and wrongly credited to Shayne Ward. (Listen closely to Westlife songs and to Ward's songs - you can tell the difference between the voices)<br /><br />Shane Filan later released his own version of this song from his third studio album, Love Always in 2017 :) <br /><br />****NO copyright infringement intended.
