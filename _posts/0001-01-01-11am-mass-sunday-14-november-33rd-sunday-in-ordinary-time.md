{% raw %}Join us for the 11am Mass at St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne. Mass is offered for you and your intentions.<br /><br />[Act of Spiritual Communion]<br />My Jesus, I believe that you are present in the Most Holy Sacrament. I love You above all things and I desire to receive You into my soul. Since I cannot at this moment receive You sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace You as if You were already there, and unite myself wholly to You. Never permit me to be separated from You. Amen.{% endraw %}
