{% raw %}State of Affairs 1x07 &quot;Bellerophon&quot; - Sixty-five photos of national landmarks suddenly surface, all featuring the är rissãlah symbol. Meanwhile, a college student claiming to be an är rissãlah operative breaks into the White House. The 7th floor team works to figure out the identities of the picture takers as the hunt for Al Moosari continues. Charlie (Katherine Heigl), now in Yemen, desperately tries to make contact with her asset while evading the Yemeni secret police. Nick’s (guest star Chris L. McKenna) masked captor lets him go only to lead him to his next mission. Back at Langley, Lucas (Adam Kaufman) takes the lead on the interrogation of a potential, and very controversial, är rissãlah member. At the same time, President Payton (Alfre Woodard) must make a hard choice between getting a much-needed win or holding out for her long-term goal of killing Sheikh Hakam. Sheila Vand, Tommy Savas, Cliff Chamberlain and David Harbour also star. Guest starring Nestor Carbonell, Melinda McGraw and Anil Kumar.
