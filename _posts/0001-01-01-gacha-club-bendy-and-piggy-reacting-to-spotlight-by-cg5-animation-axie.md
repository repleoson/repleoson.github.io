{% raw %}As times go by for the Bendy and Piggy Fandoms hanging out a lot in the Multiverse, these two related but different fandoms seemed to know what their own lore is and storyline. Today, Bendy and the returning Piggy Characters among with Mousy and Robby will be reacting to Spotlight! Spotlight was one of the ironic and first Bendy Song that CG5 ever made with CK9C and the great Dolvondo. This time, the fandoms will be watching the 2019 Remake of Spotlight by Axie, who did the animation of the original Spotlight. However there will be 3 more videos like this one, that I will be working on real soon. The last one will be a bonus, and I think the song and animation in a Bendy Version will be a blast. Also, don't forget to follow me on Instagram @isaiahtiu. But without wasting your time here, enjoy the video.<br /><br />#BENDY #gachaclub #piggyroblox #robloxpiggy #BATIM #piggybook2 #BATDR<br /><br />Original Video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dlHNC-YlGi8">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dlHNC-YlGi8</a><br />Axie's Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCuusrNG27Cy5a_2cG41gnXg">https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCuusrNG27Cy5a_2cG41gnXg</a><br />Original Song: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8gpxc5sSA">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8gpxc5sSA</a><br />CG5's Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCLCdyRg3u5O-EVP5p46QxcQ">https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCLCdyRg3u5O-EVP5p46QxcQ</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER<br />Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
