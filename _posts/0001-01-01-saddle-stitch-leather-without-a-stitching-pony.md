Why? Well...it was just the was we learned many years ago! In this video we're teaching you how to hand sew leather with a two needle saddle stitch without the use of a stitching pony. <br /><br />This method may not be something you like, and that's totally ok! A long time ago someone told me &quot;the only right way to do something in leather is the wrong way!&quot; and that's stood true for me since. Everyone has their own way of going about different skills in leather craft, and stitching is a very personal skill to master. So look at this as an option, and if you like it you can use this video to learn our method of saddle stitch and get good at it!<br /><br />Thanks to Weaver Leather as always for sponsoring our videos :) The first link up top will bring you to all the tools and materials we used in this video!{% endraw %}
