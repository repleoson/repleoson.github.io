{% raw %}The person who is unbalanced and lacks Biblical knowledge can become a “Christian fanatic” and harm both the church and the unbelieving world. To the church they lay rules on the Christian that Jesus Christ never made and they burden God’s people like the Pharisees did. To the unbeliever the fanatic makes him stumble at Christianity before he ever gets to stumble at the Gospel. Yet the only thing the unbeliever should stumble at is the Gospel we proclaim. So we must know our Bible’s so that it won’t be said of us “My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge;” – Hosea 4:6.<br /><br />MP3: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://illbehonest.com/destroyed-for-lack-of-knowledge-paul-washer">http://illbehonest.com/destroyed-for-lack-of-knowledge-paul-washer</a><br /><br />Paul Washer | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://heartcrymissionary.com">http://heartcrymissionary.com</a><br /><br />Excerpt from the full sermon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://player.subsplash.com/c94fc25">http://player.subsplash.com/c94fc25</a>{% endraw %}
