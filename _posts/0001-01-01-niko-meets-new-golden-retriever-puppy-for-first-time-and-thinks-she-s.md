{% raw %}So Niko always surprises us, she doesn't like other dogs when they are big but she loves smaller puppies , kittens, birds, rabbits, fish haha you name it. She is the Motherly one and instantly goes into protect mode for them. Would love to know her thoughts all the time! A few clips here as she cautiously lets Buddy snuggle up to her pretending she doesn't want it but we all know she loves it really....{% endraw %}
