Back onboard, we hit Park Cafe gold with both a roast beef sandwich and coconut ranger cookies on the same day, then it's time for an evening full of live music and the Stage To Screen production show!! :D<br /><br />00:00 BOOM!<br />00:04 Snacking In Sitka<br />06:02 Back To The Shuttle<br />10:34 Park Cafe Snacktime<br />13:06 Dinner In The MDR<br />14:59 Music In The Centrum<br />16:05 Stage To Screen Show<br /><br />We're off on the first of two &quot;side-by-side&quot; cruises to Alaska, this time aboard Serenade Of The Seas from Royal Caribbean!
