{% raw %}On the 27th of May, 1962, a small team of workers were tasked with clearing up a landfill site just outside of Centralia, Pennsylvania. Just as they had done many other times before at many other landfills, they set fire to the accumulated waste, let it burn, and then doused the whole thing with water. There was only one problem: the fire didn’t go out. In fact, it would never go out. Although they didn’t know it at the time, this small clean-up crew had set in motion events that would end up turning a thriving town into a smoking, uninhabitable wasteland.<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:52 - The Fire Begins<br />05:15 - The Response<br />07:41 - The End of Centralia<br /><br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery. Fascinating Horror is all about in-depth research, respectful storytelling, and learning what we can from the mistakes of the past. You might be surprised to discover just how much of today's world is shaped by long-forgotten disasters from decades gone by.<br /><br />Music: &quot;Glass Pond&quot; by Public Memory<br /><br />► Like, comment and subscribe to keep up with my latest videos<br />► Know of an incident I should cover?
