{% raw %}In this video, learn how to use &quot;compare to&quot; and &quot;compare with&quot;. You'll learn what the difference is between &quot;compare to&quot; and &quot;compare with&quot; and you'll learn which one you should use. <br /><br />Both &quot;compare to&quot; and &quot;compare with&quot; are used when two things are placed side by side to examine their similarities and/or differences. <br /><br />Both &quot;compare to&quot; and &quot;compare with&quot; use &quot;compare&quot; as the main verb. The verb &quot;compare&quot; needs to be conjugated with the subject and the time reference. <br /><br />There are two acceptable prepositions: &quot;compare to&quot; and &quot;compare with&quot;. The choice between the two depends on what you're comparing. <br /><br />If you're talking about similarities, use &quot;compare to&quot;. <br /><br />If you're talking about differences, use &quot;compare with&quot;. <br /><br />Native speakers don't usually follow this rule. Native speakers generally use &quot;compare to&quot; for both similarities and/or differences, or they use &quot;compare to&quot; and &quot;compare with&quot; interchangeably. <br /><br />Please subscribe for more videos to help you learn English and sound like a native English speaker!  <br /><br />Let’s Connect: <br /><br />Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/JForrestEnglish">https://www.facebook.com/JForrestEnglish</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JForrestEnglish">https://twitter.com/JForrestEnglish</a><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-forrest">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-forrest</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.jforrestenglish.com/">http://www.jforrestenglish.com/</a> <br /><br />How To Feel Confident Speaking English In Public So You Can Impress Your Boss and Clients with your Message In Only 30 Days - Free Case Study– <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jforrestenglish.com/case-study/">https://jforrestenglish.com/case-study/</a>{% endraw %}
