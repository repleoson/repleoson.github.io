{% raw %}🍷 Moldova is famous for it's wine but I wanted to try the real stuff, the home-brew that people make so I set off for the villages in search of some wine and drinking partners. I soon found both. Meet the epic babushkas of Moldova...Oh and they want to find me a Moldovan wife🇲🇩{% endraw %}
