{% raw %}In 1989, this story about an underground electrical transmission line spread across the early internet like wildfire. It had a big impact on me as a kid, and I wanted to share it with you! I think the Scattergood-Olympic transmission line is probably LA's most famous power line, although it has now been replaced with a more modern line since 2018.<br /><br />Original story here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2002/11/engineering-pornography/">https://www.jwz.org/blog/2002/11/engineering-pornography/</a><br /><br />Practical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.
