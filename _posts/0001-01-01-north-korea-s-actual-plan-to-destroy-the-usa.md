{% raw %}This is North Korea’s actual greatest threat to the existence of the US!<br /><br />Given how many times in recent memory that the DPRK has threatened to bring the USA to its knees with their developing nuclear capabilities, you might think that the greatest threat North Korea poses to the US comes from them launching an all-out assault against it.<br /><br />But it’s actually not that simple.<br /><br />As sanctions and embargoes from the free world squeeze Kim Jong Un and his regime financially, this may back the hermit kingdom into a corner and lead them to take drastic action to keep their cash solvent. <br /><br />This could involve selling off some of their nuclear assets to customers like Iran and Syria in the Middle East, neither of which have warm relationships with the US. They might even sell to terrorist groups if they get desperate enough.<br /><br />So the greatest threat posed by North Korea may not be itself, but by giving a nuclear punch to a lot of the USA’s bitterest rivals!{% endraw %}
