{% raw %}Explore gene expression with the Amoeba Sisters, including the fascinating Lac Operon found in bacteria! Learn how genes can be turned &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; and why this is essential for cellular function. Check out our FREE video handouts on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.amoebasisters.com/handouts!">http://www.amoebasisters.com/handouts!</a><br /><br /><br />The Amoeba Sisters videos demystify science with humor and relevance. The videos center on Pinky's certification and experience in teaching biology at the high school level. For more information about The Amoeba Sisters, visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.amoebasisters.com/about-us.html">http://www.amoebasisters.com/about-us.html</a><br /><br />REFERENCES:<br />We cover the basics in biology concepts at the secondary level. If you are looking to discover more about biology and go into depth beyond these basics, our recommended reference is the FREE, peer reviewed, open source OpenStax biology textbook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://openstax.org/details/books/biology">https://openstax.org/details/books/biology</a><br /><br />*Further Reading*<br />As our pinned comment mentions, we cover basics with the goal of inspiring curiosity for more!  There are so many important details to explore. For example, the conversion of lactose to allolactose, the cAMP-CAP conversion that stimulates the RNA polymerase, or the names of the different genes and their individual functions. We also don't mention that there are other factors that can affect the activation of this operon (such as glucose levels).
