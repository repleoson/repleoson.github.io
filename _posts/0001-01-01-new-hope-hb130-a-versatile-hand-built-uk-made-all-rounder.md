{% raw %}After a mixed reception to its first bike, Hope’s new mid-travel 29er has evolved in the right way. Despite being made with meticulous attention to detail, Lancashire components brand Hope’s first bike, the HB160, was (by its own admission) slightly outdated by the time it hit the shops in 2017.<br /><br />It’s cramped sizing and tall seat tube heights were two of our only complaints about an otherwise beautifully finessed package, so it’s with relief that we can say these aren’t issues with its new addition to the range, the HB130.<br /><br />This 130mm travel, 29er is the second hand-built carbon bike to come out of Barnoldswick, and it’s a refinement of what Hope learned from its smaller wheeled, 160mm travel enduro rig.<br /><br />For the world's best riding advice head to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bikeradar.com/">https://www.bikeradar.com/</a> <br /><br />Follow BikeRadar on our social media channels: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/bikeradar">https://instagram.com/bikeradar</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/bikeradar">https://facebook.com/bikeradar</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/bikeradar">https://twitter.com/bikeradar</a>{% endraw %}
