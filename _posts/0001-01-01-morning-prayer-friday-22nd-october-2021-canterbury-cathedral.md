{% raw %}Join Dean Robert and Tiger for today’s Morning Prayer from the Deanery garden at Canterbury Cathedral. <br /><br /><br /><br />For Morning Prayer the Dean uses the Church of England book, “Common Worship Daily Prayer 2005” (Church House publishing). <br /><br />Morning Prayer is compiled, filmed, edited and uploaded fresh each day and we aim to have it available by 11.30 each morning but due to the time that making these films takes, please be patient if it takes a little while longer sometimes. We understand that this is frustrating for some and so are always working as hard as possible to publish the broadcast as quickly as humanly possible and thank you for your patience and understanding.<br /><br />To watch past recordings, please visit our YouTube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL4_2pO--uILxV6LSRfjOpw.">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL4_2pO--uILxV6LSRfjOpw.</a> <br /><br />• SEND A PRAYER: to submit your prayers for inclusion in our daily acts of worship in the cathedral, where your petitions will be laid by Canon Emma on the altar, please click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.canterbury-cathedral.org/worship/pray/">https://www.canterbury-cathedral.org/worship/pray/</a> <br /><br />• VISIT US: The Cathedral is open to visitors and for services of worship: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.canterbury-cathedral.org">https://www.canterbury-cathedral.org</a> • SUBSCRIBE FOR FREE to receive notifications of our daily worship: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/DandCofCanterbury?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/DandCofCanterbury?sub_confirmation=1</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />• WE NEED YOUR HELP: The coronavirus crisis means that we need your support more than ever.
