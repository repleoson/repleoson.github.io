{% raw %}Late this afternoon, I was surfing youtube as always, and decided that I would look for some catchy songs. When I stumbled apron this I decided I'd upload it to youtube, but the problem was that the audio was horrible in most of the videos I saw so I found a lyrics video, and took the audio from that then combined it with the video, anyway, hope you enjoy!{% endraw %}
