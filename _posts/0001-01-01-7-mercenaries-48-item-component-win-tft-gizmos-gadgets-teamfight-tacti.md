{% raw %}Didn't want to just upload weekend videos since PBE changes so much, so here is a week day video! This one we take a big risk and take the T3 Mercenary Augment in the early game...and the risk pays off BIG. See the journey to the late game and how we make the most insane late game comp you'll see in a long while!
