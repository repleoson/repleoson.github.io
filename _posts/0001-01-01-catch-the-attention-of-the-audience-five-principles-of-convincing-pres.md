{% raw %}Do you know, how to catch the attention of your listeners and how to avoid boring bullet point presentations? In this video I’ll pass on some tips and recommendations. My name is Albert Thiele, communication coach and author. This video-clip is a continuation of part 1, where I explained the first three principles of effective presentations: 1. Focus on the listeners benefit; 2. Optimize your stage presence and 3. Define clear messages. The last two principles are 4. Catch the attention of the audience and 5. Visualize as simple as possible. I'm looking forward to receive your feedback as we are constantly improving the content and the quality of our videos. If you are interested in a seminar or coaching to improve your presentation skills don’t hesitate to contact Advanced Training (Dr.Thiele@t-online.de; www.albertthiele.de).{% endraw %}
