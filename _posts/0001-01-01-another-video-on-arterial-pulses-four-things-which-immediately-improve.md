{% raw %}Over the years watching my pulses first feeling stronger than slowly becoming visible has finally allowed me to observe four practices which when undertaken immediately increases arterial flow - my visible pulses become more visibly stronger: 1). Just going out into sunshine 2). Exercise especially high intensity exercise 3). Going into a sauna 4). Extended fasting - after fasting 24 hours my pulses start steadily become more amplified visibly. It makes sense the four practices known to improve health might also now be observed to be improving blood flow. Don’t despair if you can’t see your pulses. Most people can’t because of chronic disease and aging. Young woman before menopause often have visible pulses but lose that visibility with menopause as they catch up with men and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
