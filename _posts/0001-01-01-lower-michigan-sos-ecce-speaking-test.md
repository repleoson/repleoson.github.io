If you are a candidate for the Michigan ECCE I want you to be very well prepared in terms of speaking. You will have to be able to talk in a very formal way about yourself and about other topics that you‘re going to be asked. And I want you to be able to interact with the examiner. That means you have to listen up very carefully and understand everything that he or she says. Be able to interact, like, answer to exactly what you are asked. <br />So, to do this, you and I today, are going to work on this wonderful sample speaking test that I‘ve created. It‘s already on my blog and you can download it there for free. Made by me with much love for you. <br />Now, let‘s say you are in the examination‘s room and that is your topic. First of all you gotta read your situation. The situation here is that I am a member of a non-profit organisation and we‘re trying to raise money to fund schools and universities. So, let‘s say we wanna fund the local university in some way and we‘re asking for suggestions. We want some good ideas on how to, or what to fund. Now, next. You have two pictures and you gotta look at the pictures and ask some questions. So you ask the examiner, litelly, some  questions, right, to find out what are the options, what are the ideas presented on those two pictures and what are the advantages and the disadvantages of each and every option.<br />So, in this case our first option is to donate some basketball equipment to the university‘s gym and my second option is to donate some computer hardware. <br />Advantages basketball equipment: Students more healthy and fit. Create a positive attitude towards using the gym. Seeing university not only as a place to study and work on their career chances but also work on themselves as persons and as characters as well.<br />Advantages Computers: Students do their homework more confidently / conveniently and have access to more sources.<br />Disadvantages   basketball equipment: wears out very quickly.<br />Disadvantages computers: students must work in turns.<br />Now it‘s your turn. Give it a go and make up your mind about what is the best solution for the problem that you‘ve been presented with in the beginning of this test. You can wether leave it in the comments below or  do it by yourself. You can even download this test. I also have the examiners script included in the pdf file.<br /><br />Συνδέσου με την Μελπομένη:<br />Faceboook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/melpo.kostas">https://www.facebook.com/melpo.kostas</a><br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/melpomene_ka/?hl=de">https://www.instagram.com/melpomene_ka/?hl=de</a><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/melpo_ioann">https://twitter.com/melpo_ioann</a>{% endraw %}
