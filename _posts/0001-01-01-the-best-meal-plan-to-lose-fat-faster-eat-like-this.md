{% raw %}If you’ve attempted a weight loss diet plan of your own, then you’re probably aware that at the end of the day, weight loss is all about calories in versus calories out. Scientifically speaking this is the basic law of thermodynamics for any fat loss diet, but what this simplistic model fails to account for is how the various foods you put into your body then go about affecting these two variables. The truth is that you also need to pay close attention to the types of foods you’re ingesting everyday AND also how you go about ingesting them in your weight loss diet, as that’s what makes all the difference. In this video, I’ll go through how to eat to lose weight (with 3 diet swaps) that can enable you to lose fat faster, and provide you with a sample fat loss meal plan that puts this all together for you. <br /><br />The first swap you’ll want to do with your weight loss diet is to stick mostly with minimally-processed foods. Not only are these less processed foods beneficial when dieting in the sense that they generally provide more nutrients and keep us fuller for longer, but they also have another benefit that has to do with something called the thermic effect of food, which is the amount of calories that our body burns to metabolize and actually use the foods that we ingest. And one of the unique fat loss benefits about unprocessed foods is that in most cases our body burns significantly more calories when digesting unprocessed foods than it does when compared to their processed counterparts. So, you can further influence the “calories out” side of the equation and potentially speed up the fat loss process by simply swapping these foods for whole grain, less processed foods instead. <br /><br />Next, let’s dive into how you then go about distributing your meals (aka calories) for your fat loss diet. Research indicates that there does seem to be some indirect fat loss benefits to allocating more calories to your meals early on in the day, and is something that I’ve personally noticed as well. Now obviously this does vary for the individual and may depend on when your workout takes place, I would highly suggest even if you’re intermittent fasting, for example, to at least experiment with just shifting more of your calories to your first meal of the day as it does seem to have some unique benefits in terms of enabling you to control your cravings, burn more calories and potentially create greater fat loss results in the long run as a result. <br /><br />Now the last swap for your weight loss diet plan is to not only choose mostly unprocessed foods to include your diet, but choose the ones that are highly satiating. As this will enable you to better adhere to your diet and minimize any excess snacking you may be doing that’s sabotaging your calorie deficit. For example, even with calories equated for, simply swapping whole grain bread for oats instead will provide a 25% greater effect on suppressing your hunger. And similarly swapping brown rice for whole grain pasta or boiled potatoes would provide a 30%, or 60% boost in satiation respectively. So what I’d suggest is look over the index and experiment with swapping some of these more satiating foods into your diet and seeing how your body and appetite responds.<br /><br />So hopefully the video and sample meal plan at the end gives you a little more insight into how to eat to lose weight and how you can start planning your meals based on what I want through while still keeping everything tasty and satisfying. Although some of the swaps I mention here CAN definitely help speed up the fat loss process, just know at the end of the day adhering to a calorie deficit is most important. So experiment with your diet and stick to what you find works best for you and your lifestyle.
