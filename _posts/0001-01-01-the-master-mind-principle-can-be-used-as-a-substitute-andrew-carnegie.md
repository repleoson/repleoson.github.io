The Master Mind principle can be used as a substitute for everything save only the use of the brain. As long as a man can think, he can use this principle, and it sometimes happens that men do not discover the possibilities of their own minds until they are deprived of the use of some essential portion of their physical bodies. In such cases it may be generally said that their physical handicap becomes a blessing in disguise.<br />         <br />I know a blind man who is one of the most successful teachers of music in the United States, if not in the entire world. Before he was overtaken by this affliction he earned only a modest living, as the member of an orchestra. His affliction had the effect of introducing him to a wider field of opportunity, with a much greater financial income. Helen Keller used her affliction to make her one of America’s great women.<br />         <br />Helen Keller has proved that the loss of two of the most important of the five senses need not necessarily condemn one to failure. Through the use of her will-power she has very definitely bridged both of her physical impairments. With the aid of the Master Mind principle, she is rendering useful service by teaching the whole world the needed lesson that the mind need not remain imprisoned, even though the physical body be greatly impaired.<br />         <br />Beethoven made a similar demonstration. Sometimes the loss of physical qualities only tends to strengthen one’s mental qualities, and I have yet to know of the first man who attained great success without having met and mastered great difficulties, in the form of temporary defeat. Every time a man rises from defeat, he becomes mentally and spiritually stronger. Thus, in time, one may actually find himself—his true, inner self—through temporary defeat.{% endraw %}
