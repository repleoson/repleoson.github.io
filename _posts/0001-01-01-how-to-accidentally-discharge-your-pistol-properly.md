{% raw %}(For licensing or usage, contact licensing@viralhog.com)<br /><br />A shooter at a local match had an accidental discharge and we were lucky enough to catch it on film. This was NOT a negligent discharge as his finger was nowhere near the trigger when the gun fired.<br />Consider all of the things he did CORRECTLY during the incident:<br />1.Gun is pointed down range and in a safe direction.<br />2. After the discharge he did not panic, but rather surveyed the situation.<br />3. After surveying the situation he awaited directions from the range officer instead of wildly handling the firearm.<br /><br />Also, consider all of the things that he did INCORRECTLY prior to the incident:<br />1. He installed an aftermarket hammer and sear that were labeled &quot;gunsmith installation only&quot;.<br />2. He disabled the firing pin block safety on his firearm for a shorter reset.<br />In his defense, this handgun had been tested and run weekly at ranges for roughly 1,000 rounds before the sear engagement failed and caused the accidental discharge.{% endraw %}
