{% raw %}NSW Ambulance Commissioner Dominic Morgan says 5,900 COVID or suspected COVID patients were transported to hospitals on Friday.<br /><br />“Across NSW, we tend to have smaller hospitals in regional settings. The risk that could be overwhelmed by comparatively smaller number of COVID being very unwell is much higher,&quot; he said.<br /><br />“What we’re doing, we're surging our retrieval resources, our doctors and nurses of our retrieval system and our critical care paramedics, we’re putting on additional aircraft, we’ve secured two with our partner airline with RFDS out in Dubbo as we speak, and we will be doing further in the south and the north of NSW. <br /><br />“Importantly, we’re also adding to the clinical support that our state retrieval consultants are providing to the regions. <br /><br />“We’re having additional consultants being there to give advice to other doctors who may be remotely located as to how to treat this very difficult and complex virus that is COVID.&quot;{% endraw %}
