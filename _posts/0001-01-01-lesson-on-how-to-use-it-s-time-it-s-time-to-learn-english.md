{% raw %}This video is about the expression &quot;It's time&quot;. This useful expression can be used in the present and it has two different meanings. It can express that the right moment has arrived to do something and we are still in time to do it. But it could also express that something should be done and it is a little late to do it, in this case we use the past subjunctive (simple) right after the expression.<br />The lesson will provide a short dialogue using both meanings.<br />It is designed for elementary students who wish to study or review English grammar and vocabulary, and for students who are at an advanced level, but who wish to brush up on some grammar rules. <br /><br />Watch, Listen &amp; Speak English !<br /><br />Mr. P. is a Canadian English Teacher/Coach from Toronto, in Canada who has been teaching English since 1997.
