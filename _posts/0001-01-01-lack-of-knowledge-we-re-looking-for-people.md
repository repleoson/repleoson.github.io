{% raw %}Grey (1983)<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />In the corner of a burnt-out building you sit with the bomb.<br />Don't sleep now it's almost time.<br />Outside snow begins to fall as the car turns the corner.<br />A figure rushes into the street clutching the deadly symbol of freedom,<br />Lets loose the destruction made of desperation.<br />The world explodes, bodies splatter.<br />The car twists and bursts into flames, spitting burning debris in every direction.<br />Screams and smoke rise the assassin staggers from the wreckage,<br />His work done - 'must hide'.<br /><br />You move in shadow, the cold blue glow of a street in winter,<br />Through the snow to the house of the inner circle.<br />You reach the door.<br />'Who is this?'<br />'The fugitive'.<br />Welcome.<br />'This is just a beginning', he says, but the rebels are betrayed.<br />Doors burst open, and machine gun death rains in on the conspirators.<br />The remaining few confess their crime, and when justice is done, die.<br />But the hope lives on; they die but the hope lives on.{% endraw %}
