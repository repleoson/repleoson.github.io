Don't make the ribs too thick or the pork belly might end up too thin. For a full spare rib, start by scoring the rib section and then remove the membrane (unlike beef ribs because they're much larger - see the beef rib video for more detail here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/hTt3wQp2dbQ).">https://youtu.be/hTt3wQp2dbQ).</a> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35FZQpk">https://amzn.to/35FZQpk</a> Meat hooks are here.<br />4:45 - Same thing, different side, time for St Louis ribs or St Louis Style ribs. Everything is the same as spare ribs, but in this case, you'll cut right through the soft cartilage leaving you with all bones and meat. These are very similar.<br />7:10 - Pork baby back ribs and country style ribs are next. If you do opt to cut country style ribs, you'll end up with a shorter rack of baby back ribs. It's all in your preference. Start by removing a lot of the excess fat from the pork loins. Then, you'll remove the pork tenderloin. The pork sirloin comes off next. Similar to the spare ribs, you can leave as much or as little meat on the ribs. More meat on the baby back ribs means less meat for your pork chops.<br />9:44 - Imagine a bone in pork loin, the bones are actually the bones that would've been removed for baby back ribs.<br />9:55 - Cut off the bottom of the vertebrae. With the vertebrae gone, you'll easily be able to cut through each rib after you smoke it. Now, grab your meat hooks and remove the membrane.<br />10:50 - Loin number, how to cut a country style rib. Count over 4 ribs on the loin and then cut that section off and remove the vertebrae. This is the portion of the pork loin closest to the pork shoulder. Trim out the blade bone. Cut between each bone and you should have 4 delicious country style ribs from each half of your pig. From here you can also make boneless short ribs. <br />____________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The Bearded Butchers are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.
