{% raw %}Omg this game almost makes me cry at the end. I grew too attached to Anna and the main character. In order to get the true ending, you have to collect all the doodle Anna ripped through out the house. One is at the end of the hall way in your apartment. The rest can be found inside the house in different phases. <br /><br />#TheChild<br />#kikiAndAnaTheChild<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0PRG_h1mp3X2drWDh30W6Q?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0PRG_h1mp3X2drWDh30W6Q?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Twitter: @bubbleknightMG<br />              <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BubbleknightMG">https://twitter.com/BubbleknightMG</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://horrorshopgames.itch.io/the-child">https://horrorshopgames.itch.io/the-child</a>{% endraw %}
