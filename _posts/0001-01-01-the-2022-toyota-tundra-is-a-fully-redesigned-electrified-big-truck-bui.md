{% raw %}The current generation #ToyotaTundra is old. It was last redesigned in 2007, making the 2021 model the oldest truck on the market. For 2022, @Toyota USA has finally given the #TundraTRDPRO the redesign it needs to stay competitive. It's new from the ground up with an electrified engine option in the form of the #TundraiForceMAX. Production of the new #Toyota #Tundra will begin in Nov with the new truck reaching dealer lots by the end of this year.<br /><br />We're also on:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/redline_reviews">https://www.instagram.com/redline_reviews</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/liketheredline">https://www.facebook.com/liketheredline</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/tweettheredline">https://twitter.com/tweettheredline</a>{% endraw %}
