{% raw %}Dr. Tawfik Hamid, a researcher at the Virginia-based Potomac Institute for Policy Studies, said in a May 7, 2019 interview on Al-Jazeera TV (Qatar) that Muslims in the U.S. have been able to practice their religion freely, and that it is therefore a &quot;superficial perspective&quot; to accuse the U.S. of fighting against Islam and of having created ISIS. Instead, Dr. Hamid suggested that ISIS was created by radical Islamic ideology, and he said that the American designation of the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization is to Muslims' benefit because it &quot;removes the political aspect that has corrupted Islam.&quot; He criticized the Muslim Brotherhood for wanting to re-establish an Islamic Caliphate and said that its &quot;removal&quot; from Islam would &quot;give moderate, rational, and merciful Islam a chance to finally defeat those ideas.&quot; He added that Muslims should &quot;look at themselves in a mirror&quot; regarding the rights they give to other people.{% endraw %}
