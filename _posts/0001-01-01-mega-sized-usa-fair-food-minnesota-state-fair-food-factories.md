Iâ€™m from the US but currently call Vietnam home. Iâ€™ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. <br /> <br />If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture. <br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />ðŸŽ¬CREDITS:<br />HOST Â» Sonny Side <br />DOP Â» Tony Sylvers <br />CAMERA OPERATOR Â» Dylan Johnson <br />VIDEO EDITOR Â» Tiep Tran <br />ON-THE-GROUND PRODUCER Â» Liz Peterson <br />PRODUCTION COORDINATOR  Â» Huá»³nh HÃ  My<br />COLOR &amp; MASTER Â» QuÃ­ Nguyá»…n<br /> <br />Selected tracks via Audio Network <br />For business inquiries: marketing@befrs.com{% endraw %}
