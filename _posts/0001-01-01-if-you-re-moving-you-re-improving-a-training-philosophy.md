{% raw %}My eBook and Training Program: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebioneer.com/product/superfunctional/">https://www.thebioneer.com/product/superfunctional/</a><br /><br />My physical book: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebioneer.com/product/functional-training-and-beyond/">https://www.thebioneer.com/product/functional-training-and-beyond/</a><br /><br />Just a short motiviational-style video! This one discusses the dogma and rigidity that can surround training, and how this is ultimately counter-productive. It's true that we need to avoid movements that could injure us, and that improving form can lead to better results... But with so many people critiquing our form and technique, we can end up afraid to do a simple push up. It's not THAT easy to hurt ourselves!<br /><br />What's more, is that you don't need to follow a strict program or protocol to get into good shape. Again: it can help! And if you enjoy training like that, that's awesome!<br /><br />But if you've been put off by the idea of working out because you think it involves lifting heavy weights and counting reps... it really doesn't have to. When you divorce yourself from competition, from trying to be the best, or from hitting specific goals you can just stop and enjoy yourself. And you'll still get a TON of benefits. So, just go outside and run around! Or play some tennis. Or set yourself a fun goal - try crawling around the local park. <br /><br />As long as you're moving, you're improving!{% endraw %}
