{% raw %}This is our mountain railways staff. They are responsible to keep all of our lifts in the best shape and running save and smoothly. Often working at great heights on top of the lift poles, their work is nothing less than spectacular. In this episode of our “How LAAX Works” series you will find out what it takes to run our lifts on a daily basis.<br /><br />► Watch more of &quot;How LAAX Works&quot; Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaO_5oECwY23ym0BhXaKgoj13CAfEIllX">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaO_5oECwY23ym0BhXaKgoj13CAfEIllX</a><br /><br />Follow LAAX on<br />- Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/laax">https://www.instagram.com/laax</a><br />- Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/laax">https://www.facebook.com/laax</a><br /><br />- LAAX Webcams <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://live.laax.com">https://live.laax.com</a><br />Download the INSIDE LAAX app for the best ticket price: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://laax.app.link/090SohH0y0">https://laax.app.link/090SohH0y0</a><br /><br />The LAAX YouTube Channel is your main source for entertaining content out of LAAX.
