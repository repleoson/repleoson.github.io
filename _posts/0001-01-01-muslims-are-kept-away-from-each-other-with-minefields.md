{% raw %}Excerpt from Mr. Adnan Oktar's Live Conversation on A9TV dated September 27th, 2016<br /><br />ADNAN OKTAR: The Islamic world is in tatters, yet people take it normally. Why should you be divided? Do you not find it abnormal? Why are you not shocked by this? They secluded you with minefields, with barbed wires. Remove that minefields, barbed wires; embrace, welcome your brothers and sisters with open arms. Of course, the republic system is great, but there is no need for passport and visa requirement. Show your identity card and cross the border. That is all. It should be that simple. The passport and visa requirement among the Islamic and Turkic countries is a cause for shame. I am more surprised by the Turkic countries; you are one and the same in every aspect. Why would oblige passport and visa?<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.a9.com.tr/izle/239324/Adnan-Oktarin-Sohbetlerinden-Secme-Bolumler/Muslims-are-kept-away-from-each-other-with-minefields">http://www.a9.com.tr/izle/239324/Adnan-Oktarin-Sohbetlerinden-Secme-Bolumler/Muslims-are-kept-away-from-each-other-with-minefields</a>{% endraw %}
