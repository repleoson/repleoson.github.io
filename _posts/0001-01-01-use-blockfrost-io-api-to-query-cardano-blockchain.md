{% raw %}In this video I review Blockfrost.io API and using it to query the Cardano blockchain for information about my stake pool. I will use this information to build a reward tracker so I can build a stats display on my pools website to show the donation amount for the month. Follow me along as I set this API connection up and come back for the next video in this series as I finish this coding project using Blockfrost.io.<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blockfrost.io">https://blockfrost.io</a><br />Docs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://docs.blockfrost.io/">https://docs.blockfrost.io/</a><br /><br />As always you can always get in touch with me if you have any questions or just want to chat about Cardano or Crypto in general.
