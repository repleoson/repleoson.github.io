{% raw %}In this step-by-step tutorial, learn how to download and install Windows 11 right now. First, we'll join the Windows Insider program. Once we join, we'll opt into the dev channel, which allows us to download and install the latest insider build of Windows 11. By the end of this video, you'll be able to install Windows 11 on your computer.<br /><br />👋 Additional resources<br />- Video that covers everything you get with Windows 11: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/fMOBpjjgDFM">https://youtu.be/fMOBpjjgDFM</a><br />- Windows Insider Program: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/">https://insider.windows.com/en-us/</a><br /><br />🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️ Common questions:<br />Q: Will I lose my apps and files if I upgrade?<br />A: No, upgrading keeps your apps and files in place. Nevertheless, it's always a best practice to make sure you have a back up in place.<br /><br />Q: Can you revert back to Windows 10 if you upgrade to Windows 11?<br />A: Yes! You can revert back. In Settings, click on Recovery, and there's an option to jump to a previous version of Windows.<br /><br />Q: My computer is old. Will this work on my hardware?<br />A: Microsoft published some fairly restrictive hardware requirements, although it sounds like they might be re-considering given the PR blowback. The insider build doesn't enforce hardware requirements currently and there's always the option to roll back to a previous version of Windows.<br /><br />Q: Should I upgrade on my primary device?<br />A: It depends on your risk tolerance. I installed it on my primary PC. By the time a build makes it to insiders, I personally think it's stable enough. It's already gone through testing with thousands of users within Microsoft. When I worked at MS, we were on test builds all the time using our primary machines to make sure product quality was high. If you're on a mission critical device, I'd recommend waiting.<br /><br />Q: What build is available on what insider channel?<br />A: You can check what build is currently available on what channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://insider.windows.com/">https://insider.windows.com/</a><br /><br />⌚ Timestamps<br />0:00 Introduction<br />0:44 Join Windows Insider Program<br />2:17 Pick dev channel<br />3:08 Download and install Windows 11<br />3:38 Wrap up<br /> <br />📃 Watch related playlists<br />- Playlist with all my videos on Windows: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlKpQrBME6xJJOa5N8PEZgcxzfUas6tT8">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlKpQrBME6xJJOa5N8PEZgcxzfUas6tT8</a><br /><br />🚩 Connect with me on social<br />- LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinstratvert/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinstratvert/</a><br />- Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/kevstrat">https://twitter.com/kevstrat</a><br />- Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Kevin-Stratvert-101912218227818">https://www.facebook.com/Kevin-Stratvert-101912218227818</a><br />- TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kevinstratvert">https://www.tiktok.com/@kevinstratvert</a><br /><br />🔔 Subscribe to my YouTube channel<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kevlers?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/kevlers?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />🎬 Want to watch again?
