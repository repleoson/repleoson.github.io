{% raw %}A funky little ditty about Team Fortress 2 - the best hat simulator around! Made in collaboration with the amazing The Stupendium. We discussed this video idea about 6 years ago, and thought it was finally time to bring it to life! ;)<br /><br />Phew! Roughly 2 months of work went into this! It was a ton of fun, and something I don't usually do! A huge thank you to The Stupendium for asking me to be a part of it!  <br /><br />You can find the song here:<br />Spotify - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Stupendify">http://bit.ly/Stupendify</a><br />Google Play - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/StuGooglium">http://bit.ly/StuGooglium</a><br />iTunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/StupendiTunes">http://bit.ly/StupendiTunes</a><br /><br />Soldier and Heavy vocals | Animation, Lighting, Editing, Additional Mixing<br />Harry Callaghan <br /><br />Vocals, Lyrics and Typography Animation by<br />The Stupendium - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvbc2N6biTMUDFE_b79TPbw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvbc2N6biTMUDFE_b79TPbw</a><br /><br />Music produced by Pacific<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.beatstars.com/pacificmusic/">https://www.beatstars.com/pacificmusic/</a><br />Mixed by Oxygenn Beats<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/oxygenbeats">https://www.youtube.com/oxygenbeats</a><br />Animated and rendered in Source Filmmaker<br /><br />Source Filmmaker Workshop assets used:<br />Enhanced Soldier model by Maxxy and Velly<br />Enhanced Spy model by Alaxe<br />Hipoly Pyro model by SediSocks, Murphy, Hecates and Game Zombie<br />Deathmatch Mercenary model by Maxxy<br />Pyroland props by wekateka and RedMser<br />Dispenser Screens by Pumkin and 'will eat for food'<br />Personality Turret model by August 'Rantis' Loolam<br />Additional props from the Frontline!
