{% raw %}In this video, I explain how to setup your cooling fans to create neutral movement air flow. This means air is flowing into the case and hot air from the CPU and GPU / Video card is flowing out. This is important to regulate the temperature of the CPU and GPU / Video Card to ensure it's operating efficiently. <br /><br />Part 2 Video ( Negative vs Neutral Air Flow | Temperature difference) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/jl10lb8XF0Y">https://youtu.be/jl10lb8XF0Y</a><br /><br />When I initially installed the cooling fans, I made a mistake and had to reconfigure them. Don't make the same mistake I did. <br />Some fans have markings on them to indicate which way the air flow moves through the blades.  <br /><br />PC Case: Corsair Carbide 275R <br />Fans: NF-F12 PWM fans<br /><br />Time Stamp: <br />0:25 Explaining my mistake and creating a positive pressure setup<br />01:30 Diagram explaining neutral pressure and how to correctly setup the cooling fans <br />2:16 Noctua fan explanation of markings<br />4:00 Using strips of toilet paper, showing the actual air movement of a neutral pressure setup<br /><br />For updated pricing on the case and other components, please check out the link below. <br />They are affiliate links to support the channel. <br /><br />Amazon.com (US)<br />Corsair Carbide 275R Mid Tower Case <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2A127PO">https://amzn.to/2A127PO</a><br />Noctua NF-F12 PWM Quiet Fan <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3gdxVl8">https://amzn.to/3gdxVl8</a><br />AMD Ryzen 3700X <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3gdxVl8">https://amzn.to/3gdxVl8</a><br />Asus Prime X-570-P Ryzen 3 AM4 with PCIE Gen4 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ggUK7x">https://amzn.to/3ggUK7x</a><br />Corsair MP600 1TB Gen4 PCIE x4 NVMe M.2 SSD <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/36s24IM">https://amzn.to/36s24IM</a><br />Asus ROG Strix GeForce RTX 2080 Super 8GB GDDR6 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2XCMRB1">https://amzn.to/2XCMRB1</a>{% endraw %}
