About, Aynsley Lister is one of the UK’s hottest contemporary blues guitarists – many consider him to be among the best in the world. His unique brand of blues-based rock delivers contemporary song writing fueled with the kind of heart and soul that’s missing from so much modern music.  Whether passionately writing and recording his own material or mesmerising audiences at his live shows, one thing is abundantly clear: music is hard-wired to his DNA and flows from his fingertips like sonic bolts of lightning. With over 100,000 albums sold, lashings of critical acclaim and years of high profile touring, Lister’s resumé speaks for itself and firmly secures his position as a leading light in the resurgence of British blues-infused music.<br />In hindsight, it's clear Aynsley was born to be a musician.  As a child he was hypnotised by his dad's old guitar and at the age of eight was finally gifted his very own.  The moment he held that first six-string the outcome was inevitable; he was going to be a guitarist.  Blessed with the coolest dad in town, regularly spinning Hendrix, Cream, Fleetwood Mac and a whole host of bewitching blues for his spellbound son, Aynsley taught himself to play with relentless dedication and a precociously attuned ear, spending hours copying his favourite records note for note.  Peter Green, Albert King, Clapton and Kossoff weren't just his heroes; they became his teachers.<br />Blazing a trail in a bar band from the age of 13 honed his skills.  By 18 he'd started singing and had also formed his first group, during which time he landed a dream support slot with Buddy Guy and released two low key CD's featuring his earliest original material.  In 1998 those self-penned titles caught the attention of Ruf Records owner Thomas Ruf, who immediately signed Aynsley and hooked him up with Stevie Ray Vaughan's producer Jim Gaines.  With a maturity that belied his years, the self titled debut announced Aynsley Lister as a major new talent and kicked off a successful relationship with Ruf Records, releasing 7 albums and 2 DVD's in ten years.  Their influence, coupled with his dynamite live shows and an intense touring schedule, earned high profile support slots with established artists like Walter Trout, John Mayall and Robert Cray, whilst rousing festival appearances alongside artists like the Fun Lovin' Criminals cemented his standing as an artist whose work, although rooted in blues, transcended the genre with a fiery modern sound that was eagerly embraced by fans of rock, pop, soul and acoustic music alike.  In 2007 Aynsley was the only British artist to be named in Classic Rock magazine's &quot;Top 10 Contemporary Blues Artists&quot;, alongside John Mayer, Derek Trucks and Joe Bonamassa. <br />Visit on site for more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.aynsleylister.co.uk/">http://www.aynsleylister.co.uk/</a><br />Dishevelled Lyrics:<br />Smokey eyes and dressed to kill<br />In she walks, the room stands still<br />People talk, stop dead in their tracks<br />(I'm) watching it unfold from a stool at the back<br />Oh, the night is young<br />We've got time to play the scene out right<br />She's got my mind running as wild as<br />The dragon tattooed on her thigh<br />Oh, dishevelled tonight<br />Tucked in a corner at the back of the room<br />Nobody wiser to what we're up to<br />Just taking a few moments with a handful of love<br />Grinding to the movement ‘neath the table above<br />Oh, let's get outta here<br />Oh, let's neck that bottle of wine<br />Slip out amongst the chancers<br />Oh it's closing time<br />Halfway dishevelled, alright<br />Dishevelled, alright<br />Back of the alley in a shadow of light<br />Up against the stonework of Pier 49<br />Sweat flows and dampens red hot skin<br />Every single moment burning within<br />Oh, hand in hand walking the streets<br />The aftermath of Saturday night<br />Blending in, shining beneath the full moon light<br />Oh, dishevelled alright<br />Dishevelled, alright<br /><br />Welcome to Orange Grey Matter!
