{% raw %}Learn how to write counterpoint, an advanced music composition technique. Many musicians are happy writing melodies and chords but when it comes to writing counterpoint they feel out of their depth. Many music students need to be able to write counterpoint and are not sure how to go about it. Improvisers might want to be able to improvise counterpoint, and anyone playing a contrapuntal piece might want to learn how to understand better how the counterpoint works. This music composition lesson is for all of you. Homophonic music is music which is essentially constructed vertically i.e. it basically operates by moving from one chord to the next. Polyphonic music operates a layered horizontal construction, in which melodic lines interact with each other. Counterpoint is all about how to construct these interweaving melodic lines in such a way as to make both melodic and harmonic sense. It all seems daunting at first but once the basic approach has been mastered you will soon be writing, improvising, and understanding counterpoint. <br /><br />ðŸ”´ Subscribe for more videos just like this: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />ðŸŽµ Become a Music Matters Maestro: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join</a><br /><br />ðŸ•˜ Timestamps<br />0:00 - Introduction to counterpoint<br />1:06 - The initial melodic idea<br />4:59 - Thinking about harmony<br />6:57 - Writing a second point<br />11:33 - What does it sound like?<br /><br />ðŸŽ“ Learn Music Online with Music Matters<br />Learn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!
