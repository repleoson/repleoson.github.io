{% raw %}The JobRouter® Sign module integrates electronic signatures into the JobRouter® platform. This allows you to generate signature orders from any process and have documents signed by JobRouter® users as well as external parties. As of JobRouter® 5.2, you can apply multiple signatures to a single document. Or attach several documents to a signature process so that they can be signed together afterwards.{% endraw %}
