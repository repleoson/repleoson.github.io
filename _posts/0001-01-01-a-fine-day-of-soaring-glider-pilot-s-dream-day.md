{% raw %}Enjoy the various parts of a flight from take off to landing while gliding over the western United States in a high performance glider (sailplane).  The airport is Nephi, Utah and the glider is a 15 meter (50 ft wide wings) high performance sailplane.  Some of the clips are advanced maneuvers so don't try this at home kids.  Hope you enjoy flying over the amazing Utah landscape!  Bruno - B4{% endraw %}
