{% raw %}*T*O*T*Ps*76 *<br /><br />Broadcasted on 12.25.1976 <br /><br />Now our little boy came up to his mum<br /><br />in the kitchen this evenin'<br /><br />While she was fixin' supper<br /><br />And he handed her<br /><br />a piece of paper he'd been writin' on<br /><br />And after wipin' her hands on her apron<br /><br />She read it - and this is what it said<br /><br /><br /><br />For mowing' the lawn - five dollars<br /><br />For makin' my own bed this week - one dollar<br /><br />And for goin' to the store - fifty cents<br /><br />An' playin' with little brother,<br /><br />while you went shoppin' - twenty-five cents<br /><br /><br /><br />Takin' out the trash - one dollar<br /><br />Gettin' a good report card - five dollars<br /><br />And for rakin' the yard - two dollars<br /><br />Total owed - fourteen seventy-five<br /><br /><br /><br />Well, as mum looked at him standin' there expectantly<br /><br />And I could see the mem'ries flashing through her mind<br /><br />And so she picked up the pen, and turnin' the paper over<br /><br />This is what she wrote<br /><br /><br /><br />For the nine months I carried you<br /><br />Growin' inside me - No charge<br /><br />For the nights I've sat up with you<br /><br />Doctored you, and prayed for you - No charge<br /><br />For the time and the tears<br /><br />That you've cost through the years, there's No charge<br /><br />And when you add it all up<br /><br />The full cost of my love is No charge<br /><br /><br /><br />For the nights filled with dread<br /><br />And all the worries ahead - No charge<br /><br />For advice and the knowledge<br /><br />And the cost of your college - No charge<br /><br />For the toys, food and clothes<br /><br />and even for wipin' your nose<br /><br />There's No charge, son<br /><br />And when you add it all up<br /><br />The full cost of my love, is - No charge<br /><br /><br /><br />Well, when he finished readin'<br /><br />He had great big old tears in his eyes<br /><br />And he looked up at her<br /><br />standing there and said<br /><br />&quot;Mama, I sure do love you&quot;.<br /><br />Then he took the pen,<br /><br />And in great big letters<br /><br />He wrote PAID IN FULL<br /><br /><br /><br />Jehovah knows when you add it all up<br /><br />The cost of real love is - No charge{% endraw %}
