{% raw %}Cosmologists challenging the foundations of physics  are featured in this documentary on VSL. Variable Speed of Light (aka varying speed of light) suggests that it wasn't the expansion rate that was enormously higher than today in the early universe., but instead it was the speed of light. VSL theory is an alternative to the standard picture of inflationary cosmology and has mind blowing implications for the way we think about the origin of the universe and other mysteries of physics.We explore whether the big bang was really the beginning, is time quantum? how do we think about black holes in this framework, experimental probes of the theory and even the possibility for interstellar travel. <br />VSL is a rival to inflationary cosmology and should you wish to learn more abut that, watch our film with the father of inflation Alan Guth  ( and others) here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqjsZEZMR7I&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLJ4zAUPI-qqqj2D8eSk7yoa4hnojoCR4m">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqjsZEZMR7I&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLJ4zAUPI-qqqj2D8eSk7yoa4hnojoCR4m</a><br /><br />Please like and Subscribe.
