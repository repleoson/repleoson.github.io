{% raw %}Part 1 of my playthrough of Saints Row 1. On this part we create our character and meet the Third Street Saints. This is one of the best gangsters games of all time and when Saints Row used to be about gangs. <br />Support me on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheProfessional1994">https://www.patreon.com/TheProfessional1994</a><br />Follow me on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Patrick21611">https://twitter.com/Patrick21611</a>{% endraw %}
