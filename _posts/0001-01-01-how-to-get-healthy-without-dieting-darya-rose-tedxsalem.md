{% raw %}Darya discusses how psychology impacts our ability to create healthy eating habits. Darya is a neuroscientist, author and popular blogger who has trained her sights and talents on solving the age-old problem of eating healthy and losing weight. <br /><br />Her holistic approach to food and health is a breath of fresh air compared to the stuffy supermarket shelves of diet shakes and appetite suppressants. <br /><br />After receiving her BA in Molecular and Cell Biology from UC Berkeley, Darya received her PhD from UC San Francisco and writes about food, health and weight loss. Her website ‘Summer Tomato’ was one of TIME’s top 50 websites in 2011 and if social media is any indicator, her message that “life should be awesome” is reaching far and wide. <br /><br />Darya describes herself as a “foodist”, which is a term for someone who has abandoned dieting to enjoy life using real food and also the name of her book – Foodist: Using Real Food and Real Science to Lose Weight Without Dieting. <br /><br />Interpretation for TEDxSalem VI (2019) was provided by student interns through a collaboration between Western Oregon University, TEDxSalem, and the Deaf and interpreting communities of Oregon. The volunteer student interpreters were supported by volunteer, certified interpreters in order to minimize potential errors. Your support of these pre-professional interpreters’ growing skills is appreciated. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
