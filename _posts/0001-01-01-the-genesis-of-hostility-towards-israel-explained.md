{% raw %}Special thanks to Emanuel Machnicki for writing the script for this episode! <br />When looking at and understanding these contemporary conflicts around Israel, it is helpful to refer to the biblical history and examine the roots of this hostility that it shows. And this hostility has a very long history, going back to the origins of the chosen people - the history of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is then that the first precedents of this hatred from the hostile environment appear, which will be repeated in various forms and come back over the next four millennia. And this is the difficulty for a modern observer - how to comprehend it as a whole, from beginning to end, with such a time span.<br />To see all the episodes follow this link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/IzraelMojaC...">https://www.youtube.com/c/IzraelMojaC...</a><br />JOIN MY CHANNEL: www.youtube.com/channel/UCrwHV7Ixq09B... <br />If you liked this episode, don't forget to leave a thumbs up and click SUBSCRIBE. <br />Facebook: www.facebook.com/Izrael-MyChannel-135461841335959 <br /><br />Materials that I used to create the episode: <br />- templeinstitute.org<br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.israel365news.com/">https://www.israel365news.com/</a><br />- www.faithcomesbyhearing.com<br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RelaxingWAL...">https://www.youtube.com/c/RelaxingWAL...</a><br /> - CBS NEWS JERUSALEM DATELINE<br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/">https://www.independent.co.uk/</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jpost.com/">https://www.jpost.com/</a><br />- Lion of Judah{% endraw %}
