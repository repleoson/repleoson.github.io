{% raw %}Out of Doors (Szabadban), composed by Béla Bartók in his 'piano year' of 1926.<br /><br />1. With Drums and Pipes - bang bang bang WHAM bang WHAM bang WHAM. Oh yeah...<br />2. Barcarolla (1:51) - you can almost see the girls bumping their hips.<br />3. Musettes (3:50) - as in bagpipes<br />4. Musiques Nocturnes (6:40) - Night Musics, not Night's Music. Not sleepy or dreamy, but with senses and awareness heightened.<br />5. The Chase (12:01) - are those arpeggiated clusters at the opening, or screams of terror? Curiously, rather than press on towards the end, Bartok backs off as in exhaustion, with a final Chomp!<br /><br />Created, edited and mastered in Digital Performer 5.13 (MOTU), using Ivory (Synthogy) sound banks. Video created in iMovie.<br /><br />Disclaimer! The music score is from a Russian edition downloaded from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://classicscore.hut2.ru.">http://classicscore.hut2.ru.</a> In the US the score is administered by the Harry Fox agency. The audio is my own.{% endraw %}
