I’m a second-year medical student in Philadelphia. I make videos about medical school, entrepreneurship, and other cool things. I love trying new things and often mess up. However, every time I screw up I usually learn something. Whatever I learn I post either on YouTube or my website 🌐  (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://zhighley.com/).">https://zhighley.com/).</a><br /><br />I write a weekly newsletter 💌 (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://zhighley.com/newsletter/)">https://zhighley.com/newsletter/)</a> linking the best things I read, watched, and listened to that week.
