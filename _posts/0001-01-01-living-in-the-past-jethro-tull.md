Originally a single and had an album named after it.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br /><br /><br />Happy, and I'm smiling, walk a mile to drink your water.<br /><br />You know I'd love to love you, and above you there's no other<br /><br />We'll go walking out while others shout of war's disaster.<br /><br />Oh, be forgiving, let's go living in the past.<br /><br /><br /><br />Once I'd used to join in every boy and girl was my friend.<br /><br />Now there's revolution but they don't know what they're fighting.<br /><br />Let us close our eyes. Outside their lives go on much faster<br /><br />Oh, be forgiving, we'll keep living in the past.<br /><br /><br /><br />Oh, be forgiving, let's go living in the past.<br /><br />Oh, no, no, be forgiving, let's go living in the past.{% endraw %}
