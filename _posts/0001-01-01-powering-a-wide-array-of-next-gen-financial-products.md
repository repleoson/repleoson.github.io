{% raw %}Let us share, in under a minute, a little about who we are. Listen up as our CEO, Tushar Aggarwal, sheds some light on our mission.<br /><br />Original source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viNFZDjj93A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viNFZDjj93A</a><br /><br />‚ô¶What is Persistence?<br /><br />Persistence is an interoperable protocol built to facilitate the creation of next-gen financial products powered by blockchain. The Persistence tech stack provides the infrastructure to effectively bridge the realms of DeFi and traditional financial in a variety of areas, whilst also enabling the creation of innovative crypto-facing solutions to expand the DeFi space.<br /><br />Using the features of DeFi and utilizing NFTs to tokenize real-world assets can solve the current problems of traditional finance, thus opening the floodgates to allow a torrent of new capital into the crypto ecosystem.<br /><br />The first DApp in the Persistence ecosystem is Comdex, an institutional-facing commodities trading and trade financing platform which has handled over $41M in transaction volume since launch. Comdex revolutionizes the $17 trillion commodity trading industry by tying banking structures with blockchain via the tokenization of trade invoices.<br /><br />Comdex is just one use case of Persistence. Our SDK toolkit can be used for a wide range of use cases e.g. general purpose NFT marketplaces, solar credit trading, and much more. We aim to create a whole suite of financial products, many of which are currently underway.<br /><br />‚ô¶What is XPRT?<br /><br />XPRT (Persistence Token) is the native utility token of the Persistence ecosystem. XPRT will carry a variety of use cases, including participating in staking to contribute to network security, and community governance of the Persistence mainchain.<br /><br />As a ‚Äòwork‚Äô token, XPRT will also accrue value in direct correlation to increased financial activity within Persistence‚Äôs ecosystem dApps, an example of which is Comdex.<br /><br />Initially XPRT will be distributed as an ERC20 token following our TGE (token generation event). Later, once the Persistence mainnet is launched, XPRT will be swapped to the native mainnet coin.<br /><br />‚ô¶Where can I purchase XPRT? <br /><br />The public sale hasn't occurred yet, the full details will be announced in due time. Currently XPRT can only be obtained via Persistence‚Äôs seven StakeDrop campaigns. See the StakeDrop FAQ below for more info.<br /><br />üåê Follow us:<br /><br />‚ô¶Persistence.one | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://persistence.one/‚Äã‚Äã">https://persistence.one/‚Äã‚Äã</a> <br />‚ô¶Twitter | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/PersistenceOne‚Äã‚Äã">https://twitter.com/PersistenceOne‚Äã‚Äã</a> <br />‚ô¶Telegram Community | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/PersistenceOne‚Äã‚Äã">https://twitter.com/PersistenceOne‚Äã‚Äã</a> <br />‚ô¶Announcements | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.me/PersistenceOne‚Äã‚Äã">https://t.me/PersistenceOne‚Äã‚Äã</a>  <br />‚ô¶Medium | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://medium.com/persistence-blog‚Äã‚Äã">https://medium.com/persistence-blog‚Äã‚Äã</a>  <br />‚ô¶YouTube | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5wq...‚Äã">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5wq...‚Äã</a>  <br />‚ô¶LinkedIn | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pers...‚Äã">https://www.linkedin.com/company/pers...‚Äã</a>  <br />‚ô¶Reddit | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PersistenceO...‚Äã">https://www.reddit.com/r/PersistenceO...‚Äã</a>  <br />‚ô¶GitHub | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/persistenceOne‚Äã">https://github.com/persistenceOne‚Äã</a>{% endraw %}
