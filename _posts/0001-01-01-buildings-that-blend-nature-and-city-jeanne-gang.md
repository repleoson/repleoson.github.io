{% raw %}A skyscraper that channels the breeze ... a building that creates community around a hearth ... Jeanne Gang uses architecture to build relationships. In this engaging tour of her work, Gang invites us into buildings large and small, from a surprising local community center to a landmark Chicago skyscraper. &quot;Through architecture, we can do much more than create buildings,&quot; she says. &quot;We can help steady this planet we all share.&quot;<br /><br />TEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less). Look for talks on Technology, Entertainment and Design -- plus science, business, global issues, the arts and much more.<br />Find closed captions and translated subtitles in many languages at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ted.com/translate">http://www.ted.com/translate</a><br /><br />Follow TED news on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/tednews">http://www.twitter.com/tednews</a><br />Like TED on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TED">https://www.facebook.com/TED</a><br /><br />Subscribe to our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TEDtalksDirector">http://www.youtube.com/user/TEDtalksDirector</a>{% endraw %}
