{% raw %}&quot;Until society represents everyone, the question will always be 'where do I belong?' &quot; Aisha Thomas's TEDx talk challenges us to imagine a world where all races are represented in all aspects of life. Where children grow up with a sense of value, connection and understanding of difference. <br /><br />Her commitment to inspiring young minds was kick-started a decade ago during a mentoring meeting with a young offender in prison. He said to Aisha, &quot;If you were my teacher, maybe I wouldn’t be in prison today.&quot; Then a law graduate, Aisha decided to retrain as an educator and dedicate her life to improving the lives of children in her community. She’s currently Assistant Principal at City Academy in Bristol, and one of only 26 out of 1346 black secondary school teachers in the city. <br /><br />#RepresentationMatters <br />                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <br />Credits:<br /><br />Our talks and films are produced, filmed and edited by a brilliant team of talented volunteers and pro-bono partners:<br /><br />Directed and Produced by Mel Rodrigues, Creative Director TEDxBristol<br /><br />Production Manager: Clare Crossley<br /><br />Filmed and edited by Floating Harbour:<br />Richard da Costa<br />Reuben Gaines<br />Chessie Sharman<br />Raph Watson<br />Tom Young                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <br />Ben Scrase<br />                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <br />Iconic images drawn by Shanai Campbell    Talk title: How YOU can change a young person’s life.<br />Aisha Thomas is a born and bred Bristolian.
