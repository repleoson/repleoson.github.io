{% raw %}Guys, where do you think a modern Little Mermaid would live now? We think it would be a house by the sea! And we can't wait to build it! Because we have a new miniature house set!<br /><br />Our wonderful house will have two floors. The outer walls have a beautiful blue color! In the evenings, the house will be illuminated with cute lights and it will be surrounded by a low transparent fence!<br /><br />On the first floor there will be a living room. We will put a soft sofa, a chest of drawers and a corner table here. And we will add some accessories and plants for comfort! It will be nice to hide from the scorching sun and spend time with friends here!<br /><br />On the second floor there will be a bedroom with a large comfortable bed. Here our little Mermaid will have her pleasant dreams! Also on the second floor there will be a terrace where you can read books and spend the sunset. By the way, there will be a music box in our house! After all, we love music so much! Do not forget about the terrace on the first floor. There you can also watch the sunset and listen to the sea breeze! We will add details, like surfboards and marine accessories and our house is ready!<br /><br /><br /><br />Check out all our miniature houses here:<br /><br />Cute Camper <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/SBWjVwmo4mc">https://youtu.be/SBWjVwmo4mc</a><br /><br />Miniature Dollhouse | Poetic Life <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/sCXS_lTZ-hM">https://youtu.be/sCXS_lTZ-hM</a><br /><br />Miniature Coffee House Kit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DcKBqSybUVg">https://youtu.be/DcKBqSybUVg</a><br /><br />Miniature Tea House <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/CIb1Ml2A-mM">https://youtu.be/CIb1Ml2A-mM</a><br /><br />This video has English subtitles for your convenience!<br /><br />Check out Slime Sam's Community Tab and see his best pictures, funny GIFs, new episode announcements and much more! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw5VDXH8up3pKUppIvcstNQ/community">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw5VDXH8up3pKUppIvcstNQ/community</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Sam's channel and give a thumbs up to motivate him to make more videos for you! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/zarVZo">https://goo.gl/zarVZo</a><br />--------<br />All product and company names shown in the video are trademarks™ or registered® trademarks of their respective holders.
