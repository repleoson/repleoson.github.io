{% raw %}Chrissy competed on season 35 of CBS’s hit reality TV show, SURVIVOR: Heroes vs. Healers vs. Hustlers, which aired in the fall of 2017. Despite being the oldest player in the game, she placed second overall, and tied the record for the most individual immunity wins by a woman in Survivor history.  In this talk, Chrissy tells the tale of her distracted life pre-Survivor, and how playing the game helped her to appreciate today and see a world beyond the clock. Chrissy is a consulting actuary and frequent keynote speaker who specializes in helping organizations build or improve their predictive analytics capabilities and data driven decisioning. Her work has been featured in publications including The Actuary, Sync Magazine, and National Geographic’s documentary television series Breakthrough. She holds degrees from the University of Pennsylvania (in Mathematics) and MIT (MBA), and currently serves on the Society of Actuaries Executive Board of Directors. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
