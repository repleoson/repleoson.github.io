Alston denied the allegations and pointed out the fact that he was living in one of the country's most Americanized cities and was a top player on one of the best teams. He claimed that he only wanted to return to the U.S. to bury his best friend, but Chinese culture says those types of excuses should only be made for immediate family. Alston claimed he's returned to China multiple times since the fallout and has been embraced with open arms.{% endraw %}
