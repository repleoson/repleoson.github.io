I take English classes via Skype so that I can speak more confidently.  <br /><br />2. I have English classes via Skype so that I don't waste my time travelling to and from an academy. <br /><br />3. I have classes with a native English teacher so that I hear the perfect pronunciation and the natural language.  <br /><br /> <br /><br />In general spoken English we can omit or delete the word 'that'. We can simply say 'so'...<br /><br /> <br /><br />Examples<br /><br />1. I have classes via Skype so I speak more confidently.  <br /><br />2. I have classes via Skype so I don't waste time travelling to the academy.  <br /><br />3. I have classes with a native teacher so I hear perfect English.  <br /><br /> <br /><br />⭐️ IN ORDER TO<br /><br />'In order to' is followed by an infinitive verb and is used when we are talking about the purpose of something. The 'why'... why we do something. We do something in order to... <br /><br />Let's look at some example sentences that an English student might say to me.  <br /> <br /><br />Examples<br /><br />1. I study English in order to get a better job. <br /><br />2.  I want a better job in order to earn more money.  <br /><br />3. I want more money in order to provide a better life for my family.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Similarly, we  can just omit  'in order' when we are speaking. So, when we are speaking , we usually just say 'to'.  <br /><br /><br />Examples:<br /><br />1. I  study English to get a better job.  <br /><br />2. I want a better job to earn more money.  <br /><br />3.  I want more money  to provide a better life for my family.<br /><br /> <br /><br />⭐️  SO THAT and  IN ORDER TO are more formal and are used more in written English.  <br /><br />⭐️  SO and TO  are short words – very easy to use – and we use those in spoken English.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Questions?<br /><br />If you have an English grammar question for me, just write it in the comments below and I'll do my best to answer you in a video!<br /><br />Thanks for watching and speak soon,<br /><br />Your British English Teacher,<br /><br />~ Greg{% endraw %}
