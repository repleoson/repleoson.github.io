{% raw %}Renewable materials. Living production. Grown and further growing constructions. Living products. Algae, bacteria, fungi can be utilized in an industrial context. But how can we make use of their adaptability, resilience, their huge variety and fast reproduction? Which processes and products can be realized already? Manifold answers are being developed by explorative experiments, conceptions and discussions.<br /><br /><br /><br />Mareike Gast was born in 1979 in Hameln, completed her Foundation Studies in Art and Design at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London (2000-2001) and studied Industrial Design at the Design Academy Eindhoven (2001-2005). After working as a freelancer with Nicola Stattmann and others, she opened her own office in 2011 and started teaching at Burg Giebichenstein Kunsthochschule Halle, where she now holds the chair for industrial design. She is frequently involved in projects, gives talks and publishes about materials and technologies as a starting point of developing innovative and sustainable products.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
