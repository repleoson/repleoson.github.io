{% raw %}How exaggeration works to manipulate people into doing things you want them to do. <br /><br />Today we examine the human constructs of exaggeration. <br /><br />Exaggeration is a representation of something in an excessive manner. There are several different ways humans use exaggeration to benefit them in manupulating others into doing there bidding. <br /><br />For example, lets say your college roommate named eric masturbates every morning at nine 27  just after eating a bowl of banana's and porridge. In order to shame him/her into stopping the morning ritual of self copulation...  You might exaggerate and describe him or her as a chronic nymph-o masturbator who never spends more than 15 second in the room without his dick in his hand pumping furiously... he slaps the sarge or she flips the bean like every single waking minute of the day. It's like choking the chicken or softening the peach is his or her job respectively he or she is going to be employee of the millennium. <br /><br />This level of exaggeration takes a once a day occurrences and increases the frequency to such catastrophic levels that it makes everyone feel uncomfortable. But if it were actually true if Eric the boy or girl roommate did flog the dolphin or send muffin morse code respectively as often as the exaggerator said they would have horribly broody mutilated genitalia... no ones genitalia could possible sustain that level of battery. <br /><br />Another common area of exaggeration is when it is coupled with sarcasm to create an unflattering over flattery .<br /><br />for example : if a one Critic were to describe the TV Show Two and a Half Men as the greatest achievement of the human experience in art, and characterize the writers as Shakespeare for the modern age weaving, thought provoking, important ideas into the absolute hight of hilariousness comedy. There is, nor has there ever existed, a show as completely wonderful. <br /><br />Such things said about a show that is more or less a laugh track with some advanced apes muttering unintelligently in the pauses shows the strength of exaggerations when coupled with sarcasm. <br /><br />Another even more common use of exaggeration is to create a more exciting story. If the real events of the day are boring one can always punch it up a bit. <br /><br />Event: a car driving 55 mph stops at a stop sign and turns right. <br /><br />Exaggeration:A car Driving 200 mph blows through 15 stop signs, hits a school bus full of children sets of a series of explosions that grow and grow until the very fabric of time and space is altered and the whole scene is rest as if nothing had happened.   <br /><br />final summation <br /><br />exaggeration tool of the human to manipulate, inflate and sometime entertainer-ate .. use it wisely...
