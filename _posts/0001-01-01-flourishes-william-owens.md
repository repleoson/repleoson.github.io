{% raw %}Flourishes!<br />William Owens<br />Grade 2.5 â€“ 3<br />B1774<br /><br />Dynamic and highly spirited, the bold opening quickly sets the stage for lush harmonies, driving rhythms and a variety of tonal colors. An excellent way to announce the beginning of your concert while leaving plenty of endurance for the rest of the program!{% endraw %}
