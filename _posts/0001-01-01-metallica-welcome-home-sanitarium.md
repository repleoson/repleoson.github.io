{% raw %}Welcome Home (Sanitarium) by Metallica of Master of Puppets<br /><br /><br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br /><br /><br />Welcome to where time stands still <br /><br />No one leaves and no one will <br /><br />Moon is full, never seems to change <br /><br />Just labeled mentally deranged <br /><br />Dream the same thing every night <br /><br />I see our freedom in my sight <br /><br />No locked doors, no windows barred <br /><br />No things to make my brain seem scarred <br /><br /><br /><br />Sleep, my friend, and you will see <br /><br />That dream is my reality <br /><br />They keep me locked up in this cage <br /><br />Can't they see it's why my brain says &quot;rage&quot; <br /><br /><br /><br />Sanitarium, leave me be <br /><br />Sanitarium, just leave me alone <br /><br /><br /><br />Build my fear of what's out there <br /><br />Cannot breathe the open air <br /><br />Whisper things into my brain <br /><br />Assuring me that I'm insane <br /><br />They think our heads are in their hands <br /><br />But violent use brings violent plans <br /><br />Keep him tied, it makes him well <br /><br />He's getting better, can't you tell? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />No more can they keep us in <br /><br />Listen, damn it, we will win <br /><br />They see it right, they see it well <br /><br />But they think this saves us from our hell <br /><br /><br /><br />Sanitarium, leave me be<br /><br />Sanitarium, just leave me alone <br /><br />Sanitarium <br /><br /><br /><br />Just leave me alone<br /><br /><br /><br />Fear of living on <br /><br />Natives getting restless now <br /><br />Mutiny in the air <br /><br />Got some death to do <br /><br />Mirror stares back hard<br /><br />kill is such a friendly word<br /><br />seems the only way<br /><br />for reaching out again{% endraw %}
