{% raw %}Disney's Hulu and other streaming services are offering DEEP discounts on Black Friday. Subscriber growth is slowing down for most streamers, and they're practically giving these services away to get more people to sign up. Eventually they're going to run out of new subs and will actually have to offer good CONTENT to keep eyeballs.<br /><br />About Clownfish TV:<br />Hosted by Kneon and Geeky Sparkles, Clownfish TV is an independent, opinionated news and commentary channel that covers Pop Culture from a consumer's point of view. We talk about Gaming, Comics, Anime, TV, Movies, Animation and more. Opinions expressed by our contributors do not necessarily reflect the views of our guests, affiliates, sponsors or advertisers.
