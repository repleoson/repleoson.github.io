{% raw %}A former poly addict shares what adderall is like compared to other drugs he's taken including crystal methamphetamine.<br />If you or a loved one struggle drug addiction feel free to reach out to me!<br />Text:<br />9723724046<br />Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shamelessprotocol.com/">https://www.shamelessprotocol.com/</a><br />Social Media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CGKid219/">https://www.facebook.com/CGKid219/</a><br />SnapChat:<br />cg-kid<br />Instagram:<br />cg_kid<br />Twitter:<br />TheCGKid<br /><br />Adderall is a combination of 4 amphetamine drugs which is commonly prescribed as an ADD medication. The truth is, this drug has high potential for causing addiction as a speed drug. It increases dopamine and causes frontal cortex damage. Vyvanse is an alternative that is pure d-amphetamine, the results are the same but the comedowns aren't as bad as the adderall comedown. Crystal meth doesn't even have as bad of a comedown as adderall. Adderall XR is an extended release version of the drug which causes it to last longer. Prescribed speed is no less dangerous than what you get on the streets. Taking adderall long-term can cause severe problems including an inability to function from substance abuse and brain damage. The adderall high is so amazing and allusive to this day it's one of the few that I miss. Adderall addiction comes on rapid and has an extremely intense psychological hold compared to other drugs I took throughout my drug addiction. People need to study the adderall drug and how similar it is to the speed drug to understand the dangers. Prescription drugs aren't always safe, don't just trust your doctor. Stay away from this prescribed ADD medication.{% endraw %}
