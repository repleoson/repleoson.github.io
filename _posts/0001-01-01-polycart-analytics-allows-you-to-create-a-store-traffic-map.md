{% raw %}The Spanish company launches an analytical system, under the name of  Polycart Analytics, based on the registration of the carts and shopping rolling baskets movements inside a store.<br />This system registers every movement of the trolley from its entrance to its exit from the establishment.<br />In this way, any interaction provides data in order to know the buying habits of the customers and allows you to make decisions with accurate data.<br />Geolocation monitoring is mainly done through WIFI and Bluetooth analysis, together with the cart inertia measurement. Through the combination of these technologies you get an accurate calculation of the position of the cart.{% endraw %}
