Simply speedruns super mario 64 blindfolded. I'm doing an epic Mario 64 blindfold speedrun. Well, not completely - today I'm learning with blindfold speedrun pro Bubzia and completing up to Bowser 1. 9 Stars baby. Super Mario 64 120 star is what I've spent the most of my time in, but speedrunning blindfold would be intersting. Smallant can done this with Super Mario Odyssey, which was pretty cool. I think that blew up his channel. Anyways, simply super mario 64 world record was cool. cool cool. Big thanks to Bubzia speedrunning for helping me learn mario blindfolded. He did Super Mario 64 Blindfolded back in 2011 for Summer Games Done Quick. Okay bye! Mizkif mario and Mizkif Simply mario 64 speedrunning is awesome.<br /><br />#simply #bubzia #speedrun{% endraw %}
