{% raw %}Consulting is a very hit or miss career choice due to it's dynamic and volatile nature. As I went through my career journey as a consultant, I noticed there were parts of this job that I did not expect, which I wish I knew before I joined consulting. <br /><br /><br />In this video I will talk about the following questions/topics: <br />(Should I pursue a career in consulting? Will consulting be the right choice for me? What do I need to know before joining consulting? What to expect as a consultant at a big 4 consulting firm (Deloitte, EY, PwC, KPMG).  Work life balance as a consultant. Consulting Work Hours. Reality of being a consultant. Skill sets needed to be successful as a consultant)<br /><br /><br /><br />Let me know in the comment section if you have any questions or future videos you would like to see from me!<br /><br /><br />Music: Morning (Prod. by Lukrembo)<br /><br />#ManagementConsulting #CareerInConsulting #Big4Consulting #RealityOfBeingAConsultant{% endraw %}
