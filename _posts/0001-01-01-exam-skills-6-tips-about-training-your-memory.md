It's good to develop a technique that will train your brain to help you actively remember the things you learn. Hopefully our top tips for developing your memory will help.<br /><br />Start in class by making brief notes on things that are useful and important to you. Then revisit and rewrite these notes immediately afterwards. A good way to clarify facts and make them easier to understand, is to make mind maps. These can be drawn on paper or on a tablet or laptop. This graphical way of representing ideas and concepts helps establish things in your mind.<br /><br />Another tip is to write condensed notes or cards and stick them where you can see them – such as the kitchen wall. Looking at things over and over again can help you remember. Alternatively, you could write these simplified notes on your mobile phone and set up a reminder to read them regularly.<br /><br />It's always a good idea to use what you've learnt and to say things out loud – research has found that this will help you remember better. Everyone has a different technique – what does this student do?<br /><br />Student<br />When I want to revise for an exam, I visualise a long white tunnel with all the key topics and vocabulary written on the side of it. During the exam, in my mind, I walk down the corridor and can simply bring up all the information I need to remember.<br /><br />Rob<br />So that's mnemonics – using association to remember facts. Create an image in your mind to help you remember a word or phrase. Finally, get a good night's sleep – your memory won't work if you're tired. Follow these tips and hopefully your memory will work better for you.<br /><br />Good luck!{% endraw %}
