{% raw %}A Gateway bus carrying 39 passengers caught fire on Tuesday afternoon at Kampiringisa in Mpigi along Masaka road on it's way to Kabale.<br /><br />No passenger was injured but their luggage destroyed in the fire, as they were ordered to flee the bus, after its brakes jammed and ignited.<br /><br />Police and the minister for internal affairs Gen. David Muhoozi confirmed that the fire was not the result of a bomb blast as earlier feared. <br /><br />Investigations into the matter are still on-going and the bus driver has been arrested to aid the probe.<br /><br />#NTVNews #NTVTonight #NTVWeekendEdition <br /><br />Subscribe to Our Channel<br />For more news visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ntv.co.ug">http://www.ntv.co.ug</a><br />Follow us on Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/ntvuganda">http://www.twitter.com/ntvuganda</a><br />Connect with us on Messenger via m.me/NTVUganda{% endraw %}
