Crash diets or restrictive diets will not see you through the long-term and are more likely to end with you gaining more weight than you lose.<br /><br />In terms of the foods to eat, a weight loss diet for women at home is made up of 4 things; Proteins, Carbs, Healthy Fats and Veggies. Preparing your meals using a simple principle we call 'The Perfect Plate', means you will simply use 1 of each of these groups in every meal.<br /><br />When it comes to meal timings, there are a couple of schedules that work really well on a weight loss diet plan for women over 50. These are the 4 x 4, meaning you eat 4 meals each day, scheduled 4 hours apart; or intermittent fasting, which has you skip breakfast and eat your first meal later in the day.<br /><br />If you like this information and feel your lifestyle could use improvement, then check out our FM30X 30-Day Transformation Program at → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fitmotherproject.com/fm30x-letter-video">https://fitmotherproject.com/fm30x-letter-video</a><br /><br />Your friends here at the FMP, <br />-Dr. Balduzzi + The Women's Health Experts @ The Fit Mother Project <br /><br />P.S.
