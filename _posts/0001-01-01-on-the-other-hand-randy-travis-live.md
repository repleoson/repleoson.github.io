{% raw %}On one hand I count the reasons, I could stay with you<br /><br />And hold you close to me, all night long.<br /><br />So many lover's games, I'd love to play with you<br /><br />On that hand there's no reason, why it's wrong<br /><br /><br /><br />But on the other hand, there's a golden band<br /><br />To remind me of someone who would not understand<br /><br />On one hand I could stay and be your lovin' man<br /><br />But the reason I must go is on the other hand<br /><br /><br /><br />In your arms I feel the passion, I thought had died<br /><br />When I looked into your eyes, I found myself<br /><br />When I first kissed your lips, I felt so alive<br /><br />I've got to hand it to you girl, you're something else{% endraw %}
