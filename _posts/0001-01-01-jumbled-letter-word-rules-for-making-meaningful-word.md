{% raw %}Question-based on jumbled letters, will give you a group of jumbled (or, scrambled) letters and requires you to unscramble them to make an actual word.  For example, here you are given the letters &quot;o n m a g&quot; and you must make a meaningful word from it.<br />For making a meaningful word, you must use all the letters. Make sure you are not leaving or repeating any letters. Suppose ‘m’ is given one time then we should use it at one place only. But if any letter is given two times then we should use it two times. <br /><br />Please subscribe to the channel &quot;English Rankers&quot; and share this video.
