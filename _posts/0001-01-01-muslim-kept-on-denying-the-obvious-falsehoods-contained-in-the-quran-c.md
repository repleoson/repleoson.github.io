A Muslim asked for proof from Christian Prince why Islam is a false religion. Christian Prince gave him a lot of evidence but he was obviously blind to the truth and did not want to accept the errors in the Quran and falsehood in Islam. ✝️🙏❤️😇✔️ ❤️❤️❤️ 👌 💪😎✔️🤝✨<br /><br />✅ Powerful Bible verses to start your day: 🙏 ✝️❤️🌈🌤️<br />19 Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God’s people and also members of his household, Ephesians 2:19<br /><br />28 There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
