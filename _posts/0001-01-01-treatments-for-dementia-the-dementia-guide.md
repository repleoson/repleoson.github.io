{% raw %}This film looks at treatments for dementia, including drug treatments for dementia, non-drug treatments for dementia and treating depression and anxiety. Watch the film to hear from Consultant Psychiatrist Dan Harwood and people living with dementia.<br /><br />Currently, there is no known cure for dementia. Scientists from around the world are involved in research to try to find one. However, there are drugs that can help to improve some of the symptoms or stop them progressing for a while, depending on the type of dementia. Non-drug treatments and support after diagnosis (such as information and advice) are also valuable.<br /><br />The dementia guide is for anyone who has recently been told they have dementia. This could be any type of dementia, such as Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia or mixed dementia. It will also be useful to close friends and family of someone with dementia, as it contains information for anyone taking on a caring role.<br /><br />A diagnosis of dementia can cause a range of emotions. The news might come as a shock, or, for some people, it may bring a sense of relief as it provides an explanation for the problems they have been experiencing. It can also have a big impact on family and friends.<br /><br />If you, or someone close to you, have recently been diagnosed with dementia, you might be feeling angry, frustrated, worried, fearful, sad, embarrassed, lonely, guilty or even relieved. Everyone is different, but all these reactions are possible at different times and they are all normal. How you feel will probably vary from one day to the next.<br /><br />If you can, talk to friends and family about how you're feeling. Other people need to understand what you're going through. They might be finding things hard too, so talking can help both you and them. There are also specialist health and social care professionals you can talk to for support.<br /><br />You may find these Alzheimer's Society services - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=2236">http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=2236</a>  and other useful organisations <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=2237">http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=2237</a> helpful for further information and support.<br /><br />If you'd like to talk about the information in this guide, please phone Alzheimer's Society's National Dementia Helpline on 0300 222 1122 – calls are charged at a low-cost rate. <br /><br />The Helpline is for anyone affected by dementia and is open 9am–5pm Monday–Friday and 10am–4pm on Saturdays and Sundays.
