{% raw %}In this video, learn how to use &quot;as if&quot; and &quot;as though&quot;. <br /><br />Both &quot;as if&quot; and &quot;as though&quot; are used to make unreal comparisons. Because they're hypothetical, you need to use the subjunctive form of the verb. You'll learn how to form sentences using &quot;as if&quot; and &quot;as though&quot; using correct English sentence structure. <br /><br />In this case, both &quot;as if&quot; and &quot;as though&quot; can be used interchangeably. <br /><br />&quot;As if&quot; and &quot;as though&quot; can also be used to talk about something that seems likely/possible. In this case, you can use different verb tenses depending on the context and time reference. You'll see example sentences using &quot;as if&quot; and &quot;as though&quot; when something seems likely or possible so you can see how the sentence structure changes. <br /><br />In this case, &quot;as if&quot; and &quot;as though&quot; can be used interchangeably. Native speakers also commonly use &quot;like&quot; in this case. <br /><br />Although &quot;as if&quot; and &quot;as though&quot; can be used interchangeably without a difference in meaning, &quot;as if&quot; is a lot more common and natural. <br /><br />By the end of the video, you'll feel confident using &quot;as if&quot; and &quot;as though&quot; so you can improve your English grammar and sound fluent in English. <br /><br />Please subscribe for more videos to help you learn English and sound like a native English speaker!  <br /><br />Letâ€™s Connect: <br /><br />Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/JForrestEnglish">https://www.facebook.com/JForrestEnglish</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JForrestEnglish">https://twitter.com/JForrestEnglish</a><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-forrest">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-forrest</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.jforrestenglish.com/">http://www.jforrestenglish.com/</a> <br /><br />Free Speaking Guide - How To Speak English Fluently and Confidently in 6 Easy Steps. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jforrestenglish.com/free-guide/">https://jforrestenglish.com/free-guide/</a>{% endraw %}
