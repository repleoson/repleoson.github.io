{% raw %}Would you buy peanut butter in bulk or build your own desk to get a good deal? Do you have an unhealthy obsession with a quirky, private-label grocery store with no sales? From Costco to Ikea to Trader Joe’s, here are the secrets behind some of your favorite retailers — and how they get you to spend so much money before you walk out the door.<br /><br />Episodes featured in this Hooked Marathon:<br /><br />00:00 -- Intro <br /><br />01:07 -- Costco<br />With over 94 million Costco members worldwide, chances are you know a Costco addict.
