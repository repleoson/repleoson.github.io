This daily figure is more than the annual GDP of all but two of the largest nations on earth, China and the USA.<br /><br />Well, in this video I want to explore three things: Why is the foreign exchange market so large and influential? Who actually conducts these trades and how? And while we are at it why is it that the UK pound is so valuable compared to all other currencies?<br /><br />▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀<br /><br />📚 Want to learn more about foreign exchange?
