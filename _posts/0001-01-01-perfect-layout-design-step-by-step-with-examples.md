{% raw %}Layout design can be tricky to many designers, but today I will be showing you a step-by-step process for creating the perfect layout on your designs, each and every time. Also we will make great use of the Visual Attention Software (VAS) by 3M, as a means to make sure we are grabbing the attention of the viewer, and directing their gaze around our design efficiently. <br /><br />You can learn more about VAS by visiting <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vas.3m.com">https://vas.3m.com</a> and sign up for a free trial. You can also use promo code “Thomas” for five extra free trial credits when you sign up.<br /><br />When embarking on a new design project, you will want to consider the layout as one of the most important aspects of the entire process, from start to finish. In the video we walk through that process starting with grids, and then heading onto aspects such as hierarchy, alignment, negative space and so on. The grid is one of the most helpful methods of getting all of this correct, and it can be considered much like the backbone of your layout, or the foundation of a successful graphic design. Layout design cannot and should not be ignored or underestimated. <br /><br />If you found today’s video on layout design enjoyable or useful, let me know in the comments section and drop a like on your way out.
