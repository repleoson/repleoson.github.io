{% raw %}Cool Facts About Marvel Spider-Man’s Suits n the MCU<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE NOW to CBR! Click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-CBR">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-CBR</a><br /><br />In Spider-Man: Homecoming, we saw our favorite webslinger get a stern talking to from his mentor and father figure Tony Stark. The gist of the speech was that being a true hero is about more than just having a really awesome super suit with tons of gadgets. It’s kind of a strange thing for Iron Man to take a stance on, all things considered, but we got the message. Still, there’s no denying that there are some really awesome features incorporated in Spidey’s outfits. Today, we’re going to talk about some of the features and abilities they have that you may not have noticed.<br /><br />The Iron Spider suit comes in super handy from time to time, but we know it’s burdened with the Training Wheels Protocol and the Baby Monitor, but that’s nothing compared to what could also be lurking somewhere in the suit. The underarm webbing we’ve seen is actually a surprising throwback to one of his earliest costumes. We’ll also talk about the stealth suit that we caught a glimpse of in Spider-Man: Far From Home.<br /><br />What do you think about the selection of super suits we’ve seen Peter Parker make use of so far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Do you think they’re way too over the top or are there some cool costumes from the comic books you wouldn’t mind seeing on the big screen?
