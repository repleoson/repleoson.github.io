If you would like to support my work, you can do so using the following methods:<br />By Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/cedars">https://patreon.com/cedars</a> <br />By PayPal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/jwsurvey">https://paypal.me/jwsurvey</a><br /><br />If you are personally impacted by the issues discussed in my videos and you are in need of support, please feel free to reach out to the JWsurvey team at the following email: support@jwsurvey.org<br /><br />Alternatively, you might consider contacting the Recovering from Religion Foundation, which has trained call agents and support groups specializing in assisting those who have suffered as a result of their experience with religious groups.

I very rarely use Facebook as a means of communicating with people and I have unfortunately received hostility from people whose Facebook messages have gone unanswered. If you send a voicemail or JWsurvey email, and your request is urgent, either myself or one of the team of JWsurvey volunteers will attempt to respond. Otherwise, please understand that my time is stretched between my work as an activist and my private life, including my responsibilities as a father and husband. As much as I would like to make myself available to each and every person who reaches out to me, this will only occasionally be possible. I appreciate your understanding.{% endraw %}
