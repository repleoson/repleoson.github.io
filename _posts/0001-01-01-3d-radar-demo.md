{% raw %}The 3D Radar package contains an actor that when implemented into your project can allow you to create a small 3d map showing representative meshes for other actors or objects in the world, with freedom in their appearance and control over the radars own appearance and functions in the world.<br />There are a large number of options for controlling ranges, what targets will show up, or how they will look, to make it as easy as possible to fit into your own projects even with the great variety of needs that different people will have.<br /><br />Marketplace Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/3d-radar#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=6">https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/3d-radar#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=6</a><br /><br />Documentation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_SN7Pt98dTxS3lMi8EJZwez1KOQcwVSPsLWDeb6qb-0/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_SN7Pt98dTxS3lMi8EJZwez1KOQcwVSPsLWDeb6qb-0/edit?usp=sharing</a><br /><br />My Marketplace Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCX2LoXb1pE&amp;list=PLAgvMMfMQH2O1-YfsKXSwcFK2bvVg7UrP">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCX2LoXb1pE&amp;list=PLAgvMMfMQH2O1-YfsKXSwcFK2bvVg7UrP</a>{% endraw %}
