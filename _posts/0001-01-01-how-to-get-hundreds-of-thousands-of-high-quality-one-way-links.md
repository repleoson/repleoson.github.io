{% raw %}How to get hundreds of thousands of high quality one-way links, taking your Google ranking to page 1!  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://moneysource1.com/seo-backlinking.html">http://moneysource1.com/seo-backlinking.html</a> What's all this hoopla over backlinks? Every SEO forum and blog you stop by is constantly touting the power and necessity of backlinks they must be a pretty big deal! So what exactly is a backlink? Simply put, a backlink is a link on another website (external) that leads to a page on your website. For instance, a link on this page to a page on another website would be a backlink for THAT webpage.<br /><br />How to get hundreds of thousands of high quality one-way links, taking your Google ranking to page 1! Think of it like this: backlinks are human citation. In a sense, we decide what pages we, as internet users, want to show up in the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) by linking to the content we like. A page with more links of a higher quality than others will rank higher. The part about quality is really important. It's not just about who has the most backlinks it's about where those links are from. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://moneysource1.com/seo-backlinking.html">http://moneysource1.com/seo-backlinking.html</a><br /><br />How to get hundreds of thousands of high quality one-way links, taking your Google ranking to page 1! If you were trying to lose weight, would you be more inclined to trust the opinion of some Joe Shmo or from a professional health expert? This principle is applied to backlinks and the way they affect our rankings. Links from sites that are established as authorities (like the health expert) carry much more weight than a link from someone commenting in a fitness forum somewhere. Google weighs out these links and their value using their complex algorithm and uses this data to decide how to rank your website/webpage. Your site does not have to be a monster authority site to rank highly. Rather, you can rank highly by getting high quality backlinks from other authority sites. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://moneysource1.com/seo-backlinking.html">http://moneysource1.com/seo-backlinking.html</a><br /><br />How to get hundreds of thousands of high quality one-way links, taking your Google ranking to page 1! Let's pretend that the health expert from earlier told us that Joe Shmo actually made some good points and his opinions are quite valid. Wouldn't we start to trust Joe Shmo more and see more value in his opinion? Similarly, if an authority health site linked to Joe Shmo's small niche site, Google would realize that maybe Joe's site is more authoritative then they realized, and they would rank it higher. The web is not controlled by computers. It is run by people, and this is reflected in the way we act and link online. Search Engines know this and respond accordingly to try to give us the results that we demand and construct ourselves. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://moneysource1.com/seo-backlinking.html">http://moneysource1.com/seo-backlinking.html</a><br /><br />Article Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://EzineArticles.com/6021471">http://EzineArticles.com/6021471</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/TNtktOS0pRA">https://youtu.be/TNtktOS0pRA</a>{% endraw %}
