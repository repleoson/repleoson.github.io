{% raw %}Taking responsibility means making decisions, taking action, setting high standards, learning from our mistakes and always doing what we say. We take ownership of our work, always trying to be better, thinking differently and challenging convention.<br />We believe all of our people will make the best decision they can in the moment, so we encourage that decision to be taken there and then, rather than it be delayed by referring to someone else.<br />Because we lead people, our teams or our supporters taking responsibility also means being a brilliant coach too. Brilliant coaches know so much more than just the rules of the games. They know how to communicate and set players up in a way that gets amazing results for the team -- and they take responsibility to guide, inspire and empower athletes to release and develop their full potential.{% endraw %}
