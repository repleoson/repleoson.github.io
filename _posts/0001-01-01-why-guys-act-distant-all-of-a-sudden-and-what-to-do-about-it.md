{% raw %}This video covers exactly why guys act distant suddenly and what you can do to bring him back and get things back on track. <br /><br />So youâ€™ve been seeing a guy for a while, all seemed to be going well, but now he seems to be acting distant all of a sudden and you have no idea why.<br /><br />Heâ€™s still there, heâ€™s still around, but there has been a definite and subtle shift. Maybe he doesnâ€™t seem as excited by your existence, maybe he isnâ€™t as attentive, maybe he seems distracted, maybe heâ€™s a lot more quiet, sullen, and moody.<br /><br />Itâ€™s a gut-twisting feeling. You desperately want to get the relationship back on track but you donâ€™t know how. Every time you try things seem to get worse.<br /><br />Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ll explain everything to you. <br /><br />Full article:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.anewmode.com/dating-relationships/why-is-he-acting-distant-all-of-a-sudden/">https://www.anewmode.com/dating-relationships/why-is-he-acting-distant-all-of-a-sudden/</a><br /><br />Hope you liked the video and I hope it helps you!
