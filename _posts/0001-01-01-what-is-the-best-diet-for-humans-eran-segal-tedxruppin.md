{% raw %}Prof. Eran Segal presented conclusions from the research on the TEDxRuppin stage and made us question common dietary beliefs.<br /><br /><br /><br />For additional information see <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://genie.weizmann.ac.il">http://genie.weizmann.ac.il</a><br /><br />New research led by Prof. Eran Segals and Dr. Elinavs research unit indicates a drastic change in blood sugar levels between two individuals on identical diets - this may explain why some struggle to lose weight while others, on the same diet, stay lean and fit. The scientists even developed an algorithm that can calculate ones blood level based on his or her biology and lifestyle. <br /><br /><br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
