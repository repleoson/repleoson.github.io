{% raw %}Phone Number Spoofing<br /><br />What if I tell you that can call anyone via any phone number?<br /><br />Yes, it is not any random clickbait video or post. Scammers or hackers many times uses caller id spoofing to impersonate and try to steal money from the victim and I always wonder how they can do this. So finally after searching on google, reading old blogs, watching 8 to 10 years old youtube videos and spending 3 days, I come to the conclusion that it is very easy to do.<br /><br />1. Establish Asterisk Server<br />2. Setup SIP trunking<br />3. Make some SIP configuration<br />and there you go.<br /><br />As an attacker, you just have to set the caller id as the victim's friend or family member and you can easily impersonate and get confidential information. The scammer can also set caller id to emergency service or to police and try to impersonate you and steal your money.<br /><br />So beware of scam callers and don't give any personal or financial information to anyone.<br /><br />Subscribe to Cyber Web for more such Content!<br />___________________________________________<br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranav-gajjar/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranav-gajjar/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Pranav_Gajjar_">https://twitter.com/Pranav_Gajjar_</a><br />Email: cyberwebyt2020@gmail.com<br />___________________________________________<br /><br />Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
