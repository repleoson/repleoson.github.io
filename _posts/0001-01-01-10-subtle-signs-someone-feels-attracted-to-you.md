{% raw %}Do you wonder how to tell if someone likes you? The signs of attraction can be very subtle, from body language attraction signs like: responding to the sound of you voice, uncrossed legs, leaning in, touching and eye contact. However, some of these physical signs of attraction can be even more subtle like someone playing hard to get, hinting their availability, or showing pupil dilation. If you're someone interested in learning more about the signs someone likes you, watch this video.<br /><br />#psych2go #signsofattraction #relationship<br /><br />Individual signs do not mean much on their own, but the more you see, the more likely they like you.
