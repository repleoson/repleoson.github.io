{% raw %}Don Williams performing I Believe In You<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />I don't believe in superstars<br />Organic food and foreign cars<br />I don't believe the price of gold<br />The certainty of growing old<br />That right is right and left is wrong<br />That north and south can't get along<br />That east is east and west is west<br />And being first is always best<br />But I believe in love<br />I believe in babies<br />I believe in mom and dad<br />And I believe in you<br />Well I don't believe that heaven waits<br />For only those who congregate<br />I like to think of God as love<br />He's down below, he's up above<br />He's watching people everywhere<br />He knows who does and doesn't care<br />And I'm an ordinary man<br />Sometimes I wonder who I am<br />But I believe in love<br />I believe in music<br />I believe in magic<br />And I believe in you<br />I know with all my certainty<br />What's going on with you and me<br />Is a good thing<br />It's true, I believe in you<br />I don't believe virginity<br />Is as common as it used to be<br />In working days and sleeping nights<br />That black is black and white is white<br />That Superman and Robin Hood<br />Are still alive in Hollywood<br />That gasoline's in short supply<br />The rising cost of getting by<br />But I believe in love<br />I believe in old folks<br />I believe in children<br />I believe in you<br />I believe in love<br />I believe in babies<br />I believe in mom and dad<br />And I believe in you<br /><br />--<br /><br /><br /><br />▶️ Listen to more classic country hits: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbQ27Wemh60H36hBr5TbshAS4-bi2v5oc">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbQ27Wemh60H36hBr5TbshAS4-bi2v5oc</a><br /><br />(C) 1980 MCA Records<br /><br /><br />#DonWilliams #Country{% endraw %}
