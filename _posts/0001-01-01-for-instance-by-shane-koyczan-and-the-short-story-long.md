Thank you all for supporting it... we've gotten some incredible reviews and wonderfully positive feedback. I really love this album. I love it so much that I couldn't decide on which video to make next. See where I'm going with this yet? We opened with a video of &quot;For Many&quot; and are now considering which piece should follow it up. In all likelihood this will be the last video I produce (They're an increasingly expensive commitment with no monetary return... I do them because I love doing them... just can't afford to keep doing them.) So with all of that out in the open I want to invite my fans to make this decision. Your support has meant so much over the years and I'm often asked why I haven't done a video for this piece or that piece... trust me I would do videos for all of them if I could. How it breaks down is this. We're going to release the album on YouTube and Soundcloud. Two tracks per week with just a static image of Scott Waters wonderful cover art. When all of the pieces are finally online voting will begin on www.shanekoyczan.com.<br /><br />There'll be a list of the tracks and each visitor will be allowed to cast their vote for the piece they'd most like to see made into a video. Please keep in mind that we don't have access to grants and are not crowd funding this project. Our budget is a modest 8k which I pay for myself. So please don't expect Michael Jackson's Thriller. Another angle to this little tidbit is that we will be accepting submissions from creators who might be interested in making the video. Animators, graphic designers, filmmakers... Pixar... whoever you are... If this is something that interests you and you believe you can work within the budget... it's all yours. Submit some of your work to submissions@shanekoyczan.com; the band and I will go through and decide which style we'd like to see applied to the chosen track. Something you should consider before making any commitments is that the 8k is in Canadian funds, which is currently laughable outside of Canada, so I hope you're up for a challenge. If you do feel like cushioning the meager budget you can make a pledge on my Patreon page <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/shanekoyczan.">https://www.patreon.com/shanekoyczan.</a> This will likely be the first and last project I release via this site but every penny helps. Okay... I've talked your ear off long enough. Hope you've all been making beautiful steps toward your bliss in this new year. Hope to see you all in it.<br /><br />Cheers, Shane{% endraw %}
