{% raw %}2 February 2020. From a particularly timely passage in the book of Ephesians, Paul encourages the church of Ephesus in his prayer to find hope. Hope that is not found in us, nor in our circumstances or positive thinking, but found in an unchanging, all loving and all purposeful God. We as Christians are not only offered a passive hope, but are called and summoned into this great hope.{% endraw %}
