{% raw %}Need help buying your next car? Click the following link and my team and I will help you choose your ideal car at a fair price - from Mat Watson! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/-Help-Me-carwow">http://bit.ly/-Help-Me-carwow</a><br />.............................................................<br /><br />This is the all-new Audi Q4 e-tron! It’s an all-new, all-electric SUV meant to compete with the likes of the Volkswagen ID.4 &amp; Skoda Enyaq, and Mat’s here to see if it has what it takes to become an EV SUV class-leader! <br /><br />When it comes to the style stakes, there’s no denying that this new Q4 can compete with the best of them. It’s available in this guise or as a Sportback, and the exterior comes covered in cool creases and well designed bumpers. It’s also super stylish on the inside too. <br /><br />As for performance, there are three options to get your hands on - the 30, 40 or 50. We’ve got our hands on the S-Line 40 for this review, but the range topper is the 50, which comes equipped with dual motors and the ability to produce 300hp. It’s also packing an 82kWh battery pack, which is good for a claimed range of 298 miles. <br /><br />There’s one issue though (for us UK viewers, at least)… The price starts at just over £40,000, which means those of us in the UK miss out on the Government’s UK EV grant - a saving of £2,500! With that in mind, should you choose the Q4 e-tron, or go for something cheaper instead? It’s time to find out!<br /><br />.............................................................<br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/carwow">http://www.instagram.com/carwow</a><br /><br />Tiktok - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow">https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow</a><br /><br />Facebook – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk">http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk</a><br /><br />Twitter – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk">http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk</a><br /><br />Sign Up to our Newsletter – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/carwow-Newsletter">http://bit.ly/carwow-Newsletter</a><br />Awkward haggling is a thing of the past with carwow.
