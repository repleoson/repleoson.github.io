{% raw %}Taken from Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, formely I love to laugh.<br /><br /><br /><br />Trivia: It might interest you to know that in this clip, Paul Winchell provided the original voice of Tigger, while Jim Cummings took over Winchell's role for the New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh from season 3 until the end of its run (with the exception of the final episode: &quot;And Christmas Too&quot;, because Winchell made his brief reprise as Tigger). A couple of Winchell's last performances were for Pooh's Grand Adventure and the WDW attraction based on the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
