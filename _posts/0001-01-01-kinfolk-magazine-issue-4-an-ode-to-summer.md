{% raw %}Our promotional video for Issue 4 of Kinfolk Magazine (kinfolkmag.com), a quarterly publication based in Portland, OR. We are a growing community of artists, writers, designers, photographers, cooks and others who are interested in creating small gatherings and finding new things to cook, make, and do.<br />&quot;The stories in this volume share ideas for creating summer traditions and travels, whether that means planning months in advance or taking off for a last-minute weekend in the sun... We hope these stories will prompt you to try something new—or old—during the next few months. The meals and activities we promote with Kinfolk vary, but they are all based on our goal to create and strengthen relationships and to find more meaningful ways to connect and entertain.&quot; —Editor Nathan Williams<br />Unfortunately, Issue 4 is currently out of stock. Other issues and subscription options are available here: shop.kinfolkmag.com<br />—<br />The film is produced by Andrew and Carissa Gallo of Sea Chant (seachant.co), a stoytelling outfit based in Portland, OR.
