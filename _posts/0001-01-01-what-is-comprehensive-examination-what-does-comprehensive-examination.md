What does COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION mean? COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION meaning - COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION definition - COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION explanation.<br /><br />Source: Wikipedia.org article, adapted under <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</a> license.<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to our Google Earth flights channel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6UuCPh7GrXznZi0Hz2YQnQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6UuCPh7GrXznZi0Hz2YQnQ</a><br /><br />In higher education, a comprehensive examination (or comprehensive exam or exams), often abbreviated as &quot;comps,&quot; is a specific type of examination that must be completed by graduate students in some disciplines and courses of study, and also by undergraduate students in some institutions and departments. Unlike final examinations, comprehensive examinations are not linked to any particular course, but rather test knowledge across one or more general fields of study.<br /><br />Graduate-level comprehensive examinations are sometimes also known as preliminary examinations (&quot;prelims&quot;), general examinations (&quot;generals&quot;), qualifying examinations (&quot;quals&quot;), or as major field examinations. If these examinations are held orally, they may be known colloquially as &quot;orals&quot;. The comps most commonly come after the student has completed required coursework and before starting on the dissertation; successful passage of the comps is sometimes required for a student to be considered a &quot;Ph.D. candidate.&quot;<br /><br />The form and general requirements for the comprehensive exam vary according to the faculty or department, degree sought, university, and country, but typically tests knowledge of the student's subject area and two or more related areas, and may be used to determine a candidate's eligibility to continue his or her course of study. At the graduate level, the purpose of the comprehensive exam is to ensure the student is familiar enough with her area of research to make original contributions.<br /><br />There is no standard definition for what such exams entail, with some universities having almost no exam, whilst at other universities the process is quite rigorous. The exams thus take a number of forms, including an informal meeting of just a few hours, a critical review of one's academic portfolio, the submission of an academic paper which may take several hours or months to write, or a series of proctored exams taking anywhere from a few hours to two days.<br /><br />The comprehensive examination system is used primarily in US and Canadian higher education, but it has also been adopted by some programs in other countries such as Pakistan and India. Other countries use alternative forms of evaluating Ph.D. candidates: in the United Kingdom, for example, students typically must first enroll in an M.Phil. program and are then admitted to doctoral study only upon successfully defending their research proposal.{% endraw %}
