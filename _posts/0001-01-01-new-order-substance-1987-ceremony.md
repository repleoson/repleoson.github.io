{% raw %}This is why events unnerve me,<br />They find it all, a different story,<br />Notice whom for wheels are turning,<br />Turn again and turn towards this time,<br />All she ask's the strength to hold me,<br />Then again the same old story,<br />World will travel, oh so quickly,<br />Travel first and lean towards this time.<br /><br />Oh, I'll break them down, no mercy shown,<br />Heaven knows, it's got to be this time,<br />Watching her, these things she said,<br />The times she cried,<br />Too frail to wake this time.<br /><br />Oh I'll break them down, no mercy shown<br />Heaven knows, it's got to be this time,<br />Avenues all lined with trees,<br />Picture me and then you start watching,<br />Watching forever, forever,<br />Watching love grow, forever,<br />Letting me know, forever.{% endraw %}
