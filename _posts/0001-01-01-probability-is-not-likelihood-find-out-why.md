{% raw %}NOTE: This video was originally made as a follow up to an overview of Maximum Likelihood <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/XepXtl9YKwc">https://youtu.be/XepXtl9YKwc</a> . That video provides context that gives this video more meaning.<br /><br />Here's one of those tricky little things, Probability vs. Likelihood. In common conversation we use these words interchangeably. However, statisticians make a clear distinction that is important to understand if you want to follow their logic. The good news is that they are both super simple. The bad news is that they are easy to get mixed up. The StatQuest gives you visual images that make them both easy to remember so you'll always keep them straight.<br /><br />⭐ NOTE: When I code, I use Kite, a free AI-powered coding assistant that will help you code faster and smarter.
