{% raw %}Dietary fibers are an essential component of a balanced diet. Fibers are plant-based carbohydrate compounds that cannot be digested by our gastrointestinal system. Therefore, they cannot be absorbed in to our body. Some of these compounds include, cellulose, pectin, inulin, and lignin. Dietary fibers are broadly categorized in to soluble, and non – soluble fibers. Even though they lack a nutritious value, dietary fibers offer many health benefits. Soluble, and fermentable fibers can promote the growth of good bacteria in our gut. Some types of fiber like inulin can cause weight loss by increasing the feeling of fullness, leading to a reduced calorie intake. They also have the ability to lower the blood glucose levels by reducing its absorption. Another well known benefit of dietary fiber is its laxative effect. Due to this, fiber rich foods are considered a natural remedy for constipation.
