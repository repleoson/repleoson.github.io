{% raw %}Learning how to draw accurately is not difficult, it is all about training your eye to compare and contrast what you see. In this easy still life drawing tutorial video I show beginners how to draw accurately by learning basic techniques in a simple step by step approach. Simply, I explain how to use your pencil as a ruler to measure whatever you are looking at and compare that with other sections of the still life. To do this you must have your arm straight, one eye closed  and the ability to move your thumb up and down the pencil. <br /><br />The way it works is simple,  if a section of the drawing is twice as long as another section, you know the same has to apply in your still life drawing.  Using these measurements it is possible to create a very accurate drawing of whatever you see. In this case I use a still life as the starting point, but it could be a landscape or even a person. This art tutorial is designed for beginners and those wanting to improve their drawing.<br /><br />For more art tutorials designed for beginners and those more experienced at drawing and painting, plus hints and tips - visit my website:- <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paulpriestley.com">https://paulpriestley.com</a><br /><br />Follow our Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PaulPriestleyArtVideos/">https://www.facebook.com/PaulPriestleyArtVideos/</a><br />Email: paul@art-tutorialsonline.com<br /><br />Follow our Twitter page:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/PriestleyonArt">https://twitter.com/PriestleyonArt</a><br /><br />Interested in Art History: check out my art history channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/artistinschoolcouk">https://youtube.com/artistinschoolcouk</a>{% endraw %}
