{% raw %}This video moves quickly through an entire undergraduate Administrative Law course in (just over) two hours.  The focus is Australian Commonwealth level administrative law, but the materials work just as well for the states and territories, and they should be at least helpful for most overseas systems derived from English common law.<br /><br /><br />The video commences with a rationale for administrative law, before discussing the common law writs of certiorari, mandamus, prohibition and habeas corpus.  We then discuss natural justice at some length, before looking in some detail at the statutory scheme for challenging decisions (under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.  That takes up much of the video.  Finally, we look at mechanisms and institutions for review, including statements of reasons, freedom of information, internal review, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Federal Court and the Ombudsman. <br /><br /><br /><br />Enjoy!{% endraw %}
