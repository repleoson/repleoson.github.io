{% raw %}I’m Allowing<br />Me to be Me<br />I’m Allowing<br />Me to be Free<br /><br />I’m allowing my power<br />I’m allowing well being<br />I’m allowing my path to light up before me<br /><br />I’m allowing everything to just be as it comes to me<br />I’m shining brightly<br />I’m allowing, easily allowing all my dreams to be<br />In the right timing<br /><br />I’m Allowing<br />Me to be Me<br />I’m Allowing<br />Me to be Free<br /><br />I’m allowing my worth<br />I’m allowing my brilliance<br />I’m allowing my path to unfold now before me<br />_________________<br /><br />Create for yourself a new reality with these calming affirmation songs.<br /><br />The music is specifically designed to induce deep relaxation and sleep as it travels with you through the alpha, theta and delta wavelength stages to make significant and profound changes to your well being.<br /><br />The themes of these songs are musical affirmations inspired by the works of<br />Neville Goddard, Eckhart Tolle, Abraham Hicks, the Buddha, Louise Hay and many more. They also use the repetitive nature of ancient mantras and meditations which have been scientifically proven to lead to, and support peaceful states of being.<br /><br />This mini album is recorded entirely in 432Hz frequency which is said to be mathematically resonant with the patterns of the universe. Music therefore tuned in this frequency is thought to be highly relaxing and healing.<br /><br />Alexia's beautiful and captivating voice gently supports you on this journey to greater freedom.<br /><br />Recommended listening lying or sitting down, but as always this is a guideline so follow your own intuition at all times.<br />___________<br /><br />Listen on Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/2O0kTMB">https://spoti.fi/2O0kTMB</a><br /><br />Purchase from iTunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/2R0t2zk">https://apple.co/2R0t2zk</a><br /><br />Lyrics and music by Alexia Chellun <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.alexiachellun.com">http://www.alexiachellun.com</a><br /><br />Music Production by Moshik Kop<br />Recorded in London at NXNE Studios <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nxnestudios.com">http://www.nxnestudios.com</a><br /><br />All rights reserved @ Alexia Chellun 2018{% endraw %}
