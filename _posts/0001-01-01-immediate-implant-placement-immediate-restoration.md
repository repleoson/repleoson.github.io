{% raw %}Immediate implant placement was planned due to external root resorption. Ezi-Crown kit was used for making temporary restoration. The impression of previous crown was taken with Ezi-Clear(PVS) before tooth extraction. Point UV implant system was used for this case. This implant is very beneficial for immediate implant placement because it shows rapid osseointegration. After implant placement, temporary restoration was replicated easily with Ezi-Crown resin. Because Ezi-Crown is a light-cured temporary resin, it is very convenient to use and can shorten chair-time compare with a self-polymerizing temporary resin. Intraoral scan impression (Cerec Omnicam) was performed immediately after surgery. And temporary crown which made with Ezi-Crown was replaced with customized abutment and provisional crown 3 days later. 4 months after the surgery, the final implant prosthesis was delivered.{% endraw %}
