{% raw %}September 10, 2019 marks the reopening of The Podium, the second phase of expansion which features a bigger and environment-friendly mall and a 48-story office tower.<br /><br />Since its opening in 2002, The Podium has housed upmarket outlets and specialty restaurants. It has been a favorite venue for a variety of events in Ortigas business district.<br /><br />Today, through the joint venture of BDO Unibank and Singapore’s Keppel Land Limited, the new Podium mall redefines comfort and luxury with its sleek, sophisticated design, and wide selection of retail, dining, wellness, and leisure offerings. <br /><br />The exterior exudes visual lines that are designed to be eye-catching with lush garden walls that wrap the structure. The 2,000-square meter green wall is the largest in the country, with over 6,500 plants that help cool and purify the property’s environment.<br /><br />By incorporating green initiatives and sustainability with its new design, the mall has received prestigious awards and citations, including the LEED Gold Mark (Core &amp; Shell) pre-certification by the US Green Building Council, and the Green Mark Gold Award by Building and Construction Authority of Singapore.<br /><br />Source: manilastandard.net<br />___<br /><br />No talk, just walk.<br /><br />For the best viewing experience, make sure to watch the videos in 4K!
