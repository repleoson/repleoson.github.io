{% raw %}Love this song. Can't get it out of my head.<br /><br />___________________________________________________<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />KINGS OF CONVENIENCE - KNOW-HOW<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Riding on this know-how <br /><br />Never been here before <br /><br />Peculiarly entrusted <br /><br />Possibly that's all <br /><br />Is history recorded? <br /><br />Does someone have a tape? <br /><br />Surely, I'm no pioneer <br /><br />Constellations stay the same <br /><br /><br /><br />Just a little bit of danger <br /><br />When intriguingly <br /><br />Our little secret <br /><br />Trusts that you trust me <br /><br />'Cause no one will ever know <br /><br />That this was happening <br /><br />So tell me why you listen<br /><br />When nobody's talking <br /><br /><br /><br />What is there to know? <br /><br />All this is what it is <br /><br />You and me alone <br /><br />Sheer simplicity{% endraw %}
