{% raw %}Going Medieval continues and also concludes as we finally reach the end of the research tree to unlock all the secrets and technology that a medieval peasant could ever want or even dream of!<br /><br />Using our new research we build ourselves an apothecary's table, which allows us to mix herbs and other things to make proper healing kits! We begin with some basic ones with the goal of making some more extravagant ones, but herbs are hard to come by in winter. Alongside the apothecary table we also build a distillery to make some purest alcohol, which is another ingredient for the fancier healing kits.<br /><br />The traumatic trail is upgraded with some proper, shiny, painful looking metal traps, and they soon show their effectiveness when we get attacked. Also during this attack we see the appearance of the amazing teleporting baddie!<br /><br />To make the settlement feel a little more like a home we decide to place down an extensive network of paths, which is quite resource intensive but it should make everyone move around a little quicker plus it just looks nice.<br /><br />Also we welcome a new settler, we do some more mining and we hide from some more wolves.<br /><br />However, all good things must come to an end and our medieval journey also comes to a close. Thanks for being part of it!<br /><br /><br />NOTE: This is the Early Access version of the game.<br /><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqCa31-K_PjmEty8WX3whyw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqCa31-K_PjmEty8WX3whyw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Going Medieval can be found on Steam here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1029780/Going_Medieval/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1029780/Going_Medieval/</a><br />Going Medieval can be found on the Epic Games Store here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/going-medieval">https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/going-medieval</a><br />Going Medieval can be found on GOG here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gog.com/game/going_medieval">https://www.gog.com/game/going_medieval</a><br /><br />----------------------------<br /><br />If you’d like to connect with me, you can find me on...<br /><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/BccyEWv">https://discord.gg/BccyEWv</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheGeekCupboard">https://twitter.com/TheGeekCupboard</a><br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/thegeekcupboard">https://www.patreon.com/thegeekcupboard</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheGeekCupboard/">https://www.facebook.com/TheGeekCupboard/</a><br /><br />Reddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGeekCupboard/">https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGeekCupboard/</a><br /><br />Epic Games Creator Code: THEGEEKCUPBOARD<br /><br />----------------------------<br /><br />STAKE YOUR CLAIM<br />In the world of Going Medieval, dark age society is on its knees. At the end of the 14th century, 95% of the global population has perished due to rampant plague.<br /><br />Eventually, survivors emerge from society’s ashes, and it’s now up to you to help them settle in a dangerous new land reclaimed by nature. Build your people a home, help shape their lives, and protect them from animals, bandits, and other dangers in a lawless post-calamity age.<br /><br />BUILD YOUR FORTRESS<br />Design, build and expand your settlement from a small wooden hut into a colossal stone castle. With simple-to-use 3D terrain tools you can create the perfect stronghold, from winding underground caverns to sprawling multi-story forts.<br /><br />DEFEND YOUR COLONY<br />This harsh new world is rife with external threats, but you can give your colonists the upper hand in battle by building impenetrable defences and traps. Research, craft and equip weapons and gear so that they can fight back against unrelenting waves of attackers.<br /><br />PROTECT YOUR VILLAGERS<br />Your colonists have more than just raids to contend with. They need protection from starvation and the elements, so it’s essential to stock up on supplies and build shelter to keep them fed and warm. Maintain your villagers’ emotional states, as their moods are affected if their needs and wants aren’t met.<br /><br />SHAPE YOUR STORY<br />Grow the population of your settlement by helping out strangers in dangerous situations, or by taking in like-minded travellers. Your villagers have personal histories and agendas, and you can get to know them by observing their behaviour and relationships with others.<br /><br />----------------------------<br /><br />Channel graphics designed by Penge in The Geek Cupboard.<br /><br />Additional audio:<br />Music to Delight Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br />Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a>{% endraw %}
