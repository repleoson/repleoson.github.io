{% raw %}From the series Your Time is Now comes a T.D. Jakes sermon that will help you capitalize on the opportunities God gives you. Watch as Bishop Jakes and The Potter’s House present “This Is Your Opportunity.”<br /> <br />T.D. Jakes begins his message by emphasizing that the opportunities God gives you are beyond your comprehension and cannot be measured. A big opportunity may come from a seemingly small place. Bishop Jakes points to the miracle of the five loaves and two fish – something small that ended up feeding thousands. Don’t overlook or minimize the opportunities God gives you.<br /> <br />T.D. Jakes opens our eyes to the magnitude of God’s purpose, plan, and vision. His message is one of hope and expectation – that God wants more for us than we could ever imagine. He wants to “revolutionize” how we think, move, and function. He wants us to focus on the opportunity – His plan and purpose – and eliminate what holds us back: negativity, fear, false limitations. <br /><br />Satan, on the other hand, would have us focusing on our failures rather than finding fulfillment from these God-given opportunities. Don’t miss your moment.<br /> <br />Watch as Bishop Jakes expands on this topic with biblical examples and offers encouragement for your future. Break the chains holding you back from divine blessings. Watch “This Is Your Opportunity.”<br /> <br />Stay connected with The Potter’s House and find more T.D. Jakes sermons and special messages via our YouTube channel.<br />#LearnHowGodGivesYourOppurtunities #WhatIsTheMeaningOfGodsPurpose{% endraw %}
