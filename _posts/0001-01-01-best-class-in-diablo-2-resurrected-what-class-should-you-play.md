{% raw %}Best Class in Diablo 2 Resurrected | What Class Should You Play?<br />In this Diablo 2 Resurrected Best Class Guide we are going to be talking about the Best Diablo 2 Classes, how to play each of them, and which are the right one for you. The game features 7 different classes, and if you are still trying to figure what to play, then this Best Classes Guide is for you.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fextralife.com/best-class-in-diablo-2-resurrected-what-class-should-you-play/">https://fextralife.com/best-class-in-diablo-2-resurrected-what-class-should-you-play/</a><br />Wiki: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://diablo2.wiki.fextralife.com/Classes">https://diablo2.wiki.fextralife.com/Classes</a><br /><br />The first thing that you’ll need to do when you start the game is decide which Class you’ll be playing. If you are a newcomer I strongly recommend that you pick a class based on your liking and not based on a build guide. The reason for this, is that most builds heavily rely on powerful items that you’ll likely won’t be able to get for at least the first 50 to 100 hours.<br /><br />Timestamp<br />0:00 - Best Class to Play in Diablo 2 Resurrected<br />1:11 - Sorceress Class<br />3:11 - Amazon Class<br />4:41 - Paladin Class<br />6:16 - Necromancer Class<br />7:49 - Barbarian Class<br />9:16 - Druid Class<br />10:26 - Assassin Class<br /><br />Don't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel for more!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/fextralife">https://www.twitch.tv/fextralife</a><br /><br />Follow us on social media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Fextralife/">https://www.facebook.com/Fextralife/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Fextralife">https://twitter.com/Fextralife</a><br />Visit our wikis: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wiki.fextralife.com/">https://www.wiki.fextralife.com/</a><br />Check out our blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fextralife.com/">https://fextralife.com/</a><br />Visit our forums: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fextralife.com/forums/">https://fextralife.com/forums/</a><br /><br />#diablo2resurrected #diablo2 #diablo2resurrectedbuilds<br /><br />diablo 2 resurrected,diablo 2,diablo 2 remaster,diablo ii resurrected,diablo 2 resurrected gameplay,diablo 2 resurrected classes,diablo 2 guide,diablo 2 class guide,diablo 2 best class,diablo 2 op class,diablo 2 resurrected class guide,which class to play diablo 2,best class diablo 2,how to pick a class in diablo 2,diablo 2 sorceress,diablo 2 paladin,diablo 2 amazon,diablo 2 necromancer,diablo 2 druid,diablo 2 assassin,diablo 2 barbarian,best classes{% endraw %}
