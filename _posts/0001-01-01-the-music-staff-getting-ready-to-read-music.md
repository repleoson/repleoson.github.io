{% raw %}Before we start learning how to read actual notes, we need to learn about the music staff. A staff is made up of five lines and four spaces. This lesson will teach you about line notes and space notes, as well as ledger lines above or below the staff.<br /><br />When you are ready to begin memorizing notes, get Flashnote Derby, an app for your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch that makes it fun! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://flashnotederbyapp.com">http://flashnotederbyapp.com</a>{% endraw %}
