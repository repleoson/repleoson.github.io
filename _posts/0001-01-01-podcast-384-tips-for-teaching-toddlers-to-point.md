{% raw %}Does your toddler have difficulty pointing to let you know what he/she wants? I call it the quintessential gesture because once toddlers learn how to point, they've reached a new milestone for communicating. We no longer have to guess what they want; they're showing us!  We refer to pointing as a gesture â€“ or a nonverbal way to communicate a specific message. Research from firstwordsproject.com states that toddlers should have 16 gestures by 16 months. Gestures always precede spoken words in language development; it's a predictor of when toddlers begin to use words. Join pediatric speech- language pathologist Laura Mize, M.S., CCC-SLP of teachmetotalk.com as she shares tips for teaching toddlers (especially those with language delays) how to point.
