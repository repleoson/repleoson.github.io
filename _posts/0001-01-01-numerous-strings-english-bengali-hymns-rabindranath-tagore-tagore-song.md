{% raw %}Since 1912 Rabindranath Tagore increasingly felt the urge to express his ideas to the west. This prompted him to begin writing in English. Not only did he translate his own poems, plays and fiction, he also began to write English polemical in abundance. During his tours to England and America in 1912-13, he extensively delivered lectures on a variety of subjects including philosophy, arts and theological matters. Both in England and America he was in touch with Unitarian Universalists who traditionally and mutually share common philosophical ideas with the Brahmo Samaj (a liberal monotheistic religious sect propounded by Raja Rammohan Roy and developed by Rabindranath’s father Debendranath Tagore). <br /><br />Songs Track<br />♪.
