{% raw %}If you want to grow + shape your BOOTY, it's super duper important to activate those muscles properly &amp; feeeeel them working. A good question is always: when doing squats - does your BOOTY burn or do you only feel your THIGHS? / Anzeige<br /><br />Those exercises are amazing to target your glutes and really set them on FIRE. I get the best results when I add a resistance band / booty band around my thighs. This forces the sides of my butt to work even harder &amp; reminds me every second of those 10 minutes to engage my booty properly :D <br />You can also perform this workout without the band .. but I would really recommend you try it with one :) <br /><br />I do this routine at home or BEFORE I have a leg day with weights. Also for heavy squats, deadlifts, etc: I always make sure I do a booty activation session beforehand, so I hit the muscles in the right way. <br /><br />__<br /><br />♥︎ Your stuck with me for those 10 minutes anyways .. so make sure you use them wisely:<br /><br />1. Training legs is a lot about the mind-muscle connection. I always try to THINK about the muscle I want to work on (e.g. booty) and concentrate 100% on using this exact muscle when performing a movement. <br />You can do a squat without thinking about anything .. but you can also do a squat, pushing through your heel, pushing your knees outwards, using the strength of your butt on the way up &amp; finally: SQUEEZE the butt cheeks at the top position. <br />2. For all Squats: make sure to always push through your HEELS (back of your feet) on your way up. This puts more focus on the booty. <br />3. Also try to keep your knees behind your toes when you squat down. This is more friendly for the knee joint. <br /><br />__<br /><br />If you need more breaks - TAKE THEM! Don't worry too much about that. You will improve over time :) that's the best feeling! The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing 30s for each exercise. <br /><br />I recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles.
