{% raw %}On September 23, 2021 NASA’s Perseverance Mars Rover transmitted Ingenuity’s Helicopter onboard camera images from 2nd attempt to complete 14th flight. Ingenuity for the second time did not get off the ground. Previously on September 15 NASA officially reported that Mars’ atmospheric density went down due to seasonal variations. As a result, Ingenuity has to increase rotor blades spinning speed to 2800 rpm to fly as before. First spinning test on the new 2800 rpm speed Ingenuity passed successfully. But it still can’t fly on Mars with this setup. NASA’s engineers currently working to solve all problems occurred on Mars to make Ingenuity Helicopter be able to scout Martian landscapes for Perseverance Rover. In video presented three sets of images from Ingenuity’s onboard camera (in the end of the video). If you see carefully you can notice that stones in the center of the images are in the same position relative to Helicopter’s body. That means Mars Chopper did not take off the Martian surface.   <br /><br />Credit: nasa.gov, NASA/JPL-Caltech, NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU<br /><br />Source for Ingenuity’s onboard images from 14 flight attempt: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/HNM_0211_0685666448_205ECM_N0130001HELI00111_0000LUJ">https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/HNM_0211_0685666448_205ECM_N0130001HELI00111_0000LUJ</a><br /><br />Source for NASA’s report for Mars’ atmospheric density drop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/334/flying-on-mars-is-getting-harder-and-harder/">https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/334/flying-on-mars-is-getting-harder-and-harder/</a><br /><br />#mars #helicopter #ingenuity{% endraw %}
