{% raw %}In Valve's now iconic 'Team Fortress 2' they created the world's first War-themed Hat Simulator. Two teams of RED and BLU mercenaries battle it out across countless warzones with intense firepower and fine head-based tailoring. Somewhere behind all of this is some sort of deep conspiracy with two warring factions, corporate intrigue and muscular hirsute Australians. But really we know it's all about the hats.<br /><br />Harry101UK and I have been talking about this project for YEARS but I actually wrote it before we'd even met, long before I was ever recording music. If memory serves, I'm fairly certain that this song was the first rap I ever wrote. The earliest recorded demo of this song dates back to 2016 but the lyrics had existed for at least 2-3 years before that.<br />Of course I've been back through and updated the lyrics a bit to reflect 6+ years of writing and music experience. (the old beat I originally wrote to was almost half the speed, so some lyrics had to be streamlined to make them say-able!) The Engy and the Medic got the biggest re-writes, because the Engy lyrics were a total tongue twister that was unsayable at this speed and because I'd actually already recycled the Medic's original verse to be used in my Surgeon Simulator song.<br /><br />I moved house recently and knew I'd have to take several weeks off from working on videos to do so, so now seemed like the perfect time to resurrect this project and have someone else make a video for me for the first time. And who better than the magnificent Harry101UK? We'd been talking about the idea of doing this project for the longest time and I'm so grateful to Harry for stepping up and spending the last couple of months to make this incredible animation.<br /><br />And I'm equally grateful to my amazing Patrons who funded the project! Thank you to every one of you. I'm immensely proud of this video and I'm thrilled to be able to share it with you all after so many years!<br /><br />#TeamFortress2 #TF2 #SFM<br />-----<br /><br />Check out the full Stupendium originals playlist for all of my original songs!<br /><br />STUPENDIUM ORIGINALS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...</a><br /><br />THE STUPENDIUM ON SPOTIFY:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Stupendify">http://bit.ly/Stupendify</a><br /><br />THE STUPENDIUM ON GOOGLE PLAY:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/StuGooglium">http://bit.ly/StuGooglium</a><br /><br />THE STUPENDIUM ON iTUNES:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/StupendiTunes">http://bit.ly/StupendiTunes</a><br /><br />Lyrics, and Vocals by The Stupendium<br />Animation and Soldier/Heavy vocals by Harry101UK<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Harry101UK">https://www.youtube.com/user/Harry101UK</a><br />Beat produced by Pacific<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.beatstars.com/pacificmusic/">https://www.beatstars.com/pacificmusic/</a><br />Mixed by Oxygenn Beats<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/oxygenbeats">https://www.youtube.com/oxygenbeats</a><br /><br />Source Filmmaker Workshop assets:<br />Enhanced Soldier model by Maxxy and Velly<br />Enhanced Spy model by Alaxe<br />Hipoly Pyro model by SediSocks, Murphy, Hecates and Game Zombie<br />Deathmatch Mercenary model by Maxxy<br />Pyroland props by wekateka and RedMser<br />Dispenser Screens by Pumkin and 'will eat for food'<br />Additional props from the Frontline!
