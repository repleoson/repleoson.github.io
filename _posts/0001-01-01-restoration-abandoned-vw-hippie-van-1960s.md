{% raw %}This old rusty van was at first sight unrepairable What was worse, this minibus was falling apart more and more even during the restoration! Despite the difficulties, this crap was repaired to an interesting state ... you will see in the video ;) Enjoy the video! Your Restore Machines channel :){% endraw %}
