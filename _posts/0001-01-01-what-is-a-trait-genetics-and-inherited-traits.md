{% raw %}Traits are characteristics or features that can be passed from one generation to another.<br />Some examples include hair color, size, and skin color.<br />Long tail short tail long ears or short ears<br />Each of these factors can be passed genetically to another generation.<br /><br />There are different forms of the same trait.<br />In this next video notice the different shapes of the noses. These would be examples of alleles because they are different forms of the same trait<br /><br />Traits can also be dominant or recessive<br />Each individual has two alleles for each gene, one coming from each female and the other from the male. With dominant traits, an individual carries either two dominant genes or one dominant and one recessive gene. A dominant gene can be expressed even if only one copy of the gene is present.<br />A recessive trait will only be expressed if an individual has two recessive alleles.<br />In this example purple color is dominant over white color<br /><br />In summary, a trait is a feature that can be passed from one generation to the next<br />Learn how to extract DNA from a banana<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.moomoomathblog.com/2020/11/dna-from-banana-fun-lab-or-science.html">http://www.moomoomathblog.com/2020/11/dna-from-banana-fun-lab-or-science.html</a><br /><br /><br />-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-<br />Please watch: &quot;Study Skills Teacher's Secret Guide to your Best Grades&quot; <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3bsg8gaSbw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3bsg8gaSbw</a><br />-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-{% endraw %}
