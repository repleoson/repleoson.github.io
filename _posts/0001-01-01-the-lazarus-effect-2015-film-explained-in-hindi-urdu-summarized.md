{% raw %}The LAZARUS Effect (2015) Horror movie explained in Hindi Urdu. The American Horror Thriller film “Lazarus Effect: Evil will Rise” story summarized with a full ending in हिन्दी explanation. The plot is about some medical researchers who are doing experiments on bringing alive the dead. A scientist Frank creates such a serum, with the help of which dead patients and animals can be brought back to life. First these people use this serum on a dog and they become successful in that. In the same research, a friend of Frank dies accidentally. He used to love that girl, so he uses that injection on her too in desperation. And you can't believe it, but that girl also comes alive, but with this, many dangerous evil powers also get unleased which are inside that girl. Now this girl i.e Zoe starts killing all her fellows badly one by one. Everyone tries to stop her but all this is not so easy because Evil has come now! From this we can learn this lesson that if a person changes the rules of nature or follow the supernatural approach, then in return, nature always does something bad. Returning a dead person is not free from any danger and it is against the rules of God. For example in this film, scientists used serum with code-named &quot;Lazarus&quot; for resurrection.
