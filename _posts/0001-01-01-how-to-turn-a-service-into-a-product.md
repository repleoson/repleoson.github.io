{% raw %}Brian Casel here, answering another reader's question from my newsletter.

Any specific tactics you can share?<br /><br />First, what does it mean to &quot;transition&quot;?  We're talking about serving anyone and everyone, to becoming a much more specific, more repeatable, more predictable, version of your service.<br /><br />That's what I think about when productizing a service.  <br /><br />So now here's a quick productization framework.  It boils down to 3 big steps:<br /><br />1.  Pick the right customer<br /><br />2.  Pick a valuable problem to solve<br />  - Evidence that they're aware of this problem<br />  - Evidence that they pay for it<br /><br />3.  Create a more predictable version of your service.<br /><br />Obviously, none of this will happen overnight.  You will need to go through many rounds of trial and error on each of these steps.  But this process is well worth it!{% endraw %}
