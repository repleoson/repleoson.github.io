{% raw %}Song from the movie &quot;Country Strong&quot; played by Garret Hedlund<br /><br />This my grandpa's old Gibson, and a girl of no importance,<br />A shot of whiskey sitting on the bar.<br />Yeah, I used to give a damn; I used to try real hard.<br />But I'll give in tonight, chances are.<br /><br />One foot on the narrow way, and one foot on the ledge.<br />Sifting through the devil's lies, and what the good Book says.<br />If I'm going anywhere, I'll probably go too far.<br />And probably away from you, chances are.<br />Chances are.<br /><br />Well, there's a lonely corner waiting; two sets left for playing.<br />And I'll tell her everything she wants to hear.<br />Well I'm not worth the love that's making, I'm better at the breaking.<br />A guy like me knows how to disappear.<br /><br />One foot on the narrow way, and one foot on the ledge.<br />Sifting through the devil's lies, and what the good Book says.<br />If I'm going anywhere, I'll probably go too far.<br />And probably away from you, chances are.<br />Chances are.<br /><br />Hold you like I mean it. Say it 'til you believe it.<br />And we'll see if we can fill an empty heart.<br />But I won't tell you what the chances are.<br /><br />One foot on the narrow way, and one foot on the ledge.<br />Sifting through the devil's lies, and what the good Book says.<br />If I'm going anywhere, I'll probably go too far.<br />And probably away from you, chances are.<br />Chances are.{% endraw %}
