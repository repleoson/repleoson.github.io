{% raw %}Adapted from the celebrated 1929 novel of the same name by Nella Larsen, PASSING tells the story of two Black women, Irene Redfield (Tessa Thompson) and Clare Kendry (Academy Award nominee Ruth Negga), who can “pass” as white but choose to live on opposite sides of the color line during the height of the Harlem Renaissance in late 1920s New York. After a chance encounter reunites the former childhood friends one summer afternoon, Irene reluctantly allows Clare into her home, where she ingratiates herself to Irene’s husband (André Holland) and family, and soon her larger social circle as well. As their lives become more deeply intertwined, Irene finds her once-steady existence upended by Clare, and PASSING becomes a riveting examination of obsession, repression and the lies people tell themselves and others to protect their carefully constructed realities.<br /><br />Watch Passing, only on Netflix: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81424320">https://www.netflix.com/title/81424320</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/29qBUt7">http://bit.ly/29qBUt7</a><br /><br />About Netflix:<br />Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with over 209 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages.
