{% raw %}I can think of younger days when living for my life<br /><br />Was everything a man could want to do<br /><br />I could never see tomorrow, but I was never told about the sorrow<br /><br /><br /><br />And how can you mend a broken heart?<br /><br />How can you stop the rain from falling down?<br /><br />How can you stop the sun from shining?<br /><br />What makes the world go round?<br /><br />How can you mend a this broken man?<br /><br />How can a loser ever win?<br /><br />Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again<br /><br /><br /><br />I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees<br /><br />And misty memories of days gone by<br /><br />We could never see tomorrow, no one said a word about the sorrow<br /><br /><br /><br />And how can you mend a broken heart?<br /><br />How can you stop the rain from falling down?<br /><br />How can you stop the sun from shining?<br /><br />What makes the world go round?<br /><br />How can you mend this broken man?<br /><br />How can a loser ever win?<br /><br />Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again{% endraw %}
