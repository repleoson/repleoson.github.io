{% raw %}The Lucy Mission is days away from launching its spacecraft on a 12 year mission which will carry it out to Jupiter's orbit and back twice. This enables it to visit both swarms of Trojan asteroids, a cloud of asteroids which have been trapped by Jupiter's gravity since the early days of the solar system. During this flight it will be able to fly by 6 targets, one of which has a moon and another is a large binary asteroid - making for a total of 8 asteroids with one spacecraft.<br /><br />Follow me on Twitter for more updates:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DJSnM">https://twitter.com/DJSnM</a><br /><br />I have a discord server where I regularly turn up:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/zStmKbM">https://discord.gg/zStmKbM</a><br /><br />If you really like what I do you can support me directly through Patreon<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/scottmanley">https://www.patreon.com/scottmanley</a><br /><br />Thumbnail design by Watermelon{% endraw %}
