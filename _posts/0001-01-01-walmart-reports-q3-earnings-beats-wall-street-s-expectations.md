Walmart raised its forecast for the year, saying adjusted earnings per share will be around $6.40 versus its prior expectations of between $6.20 and $6.35. <br /><br />Shares are down about 1% in premarket trading.<br /><br />Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the retailer is optimistic about the holidays and will have shelves stocked. Inventory for Walmart in the U.S. is up 11.5% ahead of the busy shopping season, he said. The retailer ordered its seasonal merchandise early and has prioritized space for it on ships.<br /><br />“There’s a level of excitement in the air,” he said on the company’s earnings call. “You can feel it. I’ve been walking away from these stores with a recurring thought, ‘We’re ready, we have the people, the products, and the prices to deliver a great holiday season.’”<br /><br />Here’s what the company reported for the fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 31, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates:<br /><br />Earnings per share: $1.45 adjusted vs. $1.40 expected<br />Revenue: $140.53 billion vs. $135.60 billion expected<br />Walmart’s net income fell to $3.11 billion, or $1.11 per share, from $5.14 billion, or $1.80 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.45 per share. Analysts were expecting Walmart would earn $1.40 per share, according to Refinitiv.<br /><br />Total revenue grew by about 4% to $140.53 billion from $134.7 billion a year earlier, exceeding Wall Street’s expectations of $135.60 billion.<br /><br />Walmart’s same-store sales in the U.S. grew by 9.2%, excluding fuel, higher than the 6.9% expected by a StreetAccount survey. <br /><br />Walmart’s e-commerce sales in the U.S. grew 8% versus the year-ago quarter — or 87% on a two-year basis.<br /><br />Inflation is hitting consumers as they go about daily routines, from filling up the gas tank to stocking the refrigerator. Annual inflation rose at its fastest pace in more than three decades in September, according to the Commerce Department.<br /><br />Walmart, known for its emphasis on “Everyday Low Price,” is one of the retailers that stands to better weather a period of rising prices. As consumers feel sticker shock, they may buy more of their groceries, clothes and other goods at the retailer’s stores and website instead of turning to competitors.<br /><br />“We’ve always been an inflation fighter for customers,” Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said in an interview with CNBC. “Our scale and the product breadth that we have allows us to do things in a way that is beneficial to customers and beneficial to shareholders.”<br /><br />Biggs said food inflation was in the low to mid single-digits in the three-month period. He said the company is feeling pressure from the rising cost of fuel, shipping and products, but it has been able to reduce the number of promotions without hurting its sales. Also, it has gotten a boost from new revenue from its growing advertising business.<br /><br />Biggs said the company has not seen signs so far of trading down — such as buying smaller packs or cheaper brands — but said the retailer may be picking up customers who are looking to save money and time.<br /><br />Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a press release that the company is gaining market share in grocery as U.S. consumers return to stores.<br /><br />» Subscribe to CNBC TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic</a> <br /><br />Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.
