{% raw %}In this epic Talk, Colin O'Brady, explains his journey back from a tragic burn accident only to ascend to the 7 tallest mountains and two poles on earth - in world record time.<br /><br /><br /><br />His idea is centered around mindfulness and how one can achieve anything no matter the circumstances. <br /><br /><br /><br />With special thanks to the UNIVERSITY OF OREGON for presenting partnership, a world class stage design provided by HENRY V, an incredible legacy bound book provided by PREMIER and to the creative digital craft provided by ENJOY THE WEATHER. All of our Partners and event history can be found TEDxPortland.com <br /><br /><br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)<br /><br /><br /><br />Colin, a native of Portland, is a testament to mindfulness, setting audacious goals and achieving them despite overwhelming odds. Last year, Colin set two world records: He became the fastest person ever to complete both the Seven Summits (climbing the highest peak on every continent) and the Explorers Grand Slam (the Seven Summits + skiing to the last degree of the North and South Poles). He completed the challenges in 131 and 139 days, respectively. His nonprofit, Beyond 7/2, strives to inspire kids to lead active, healthy lives and pursue their biggest dreams.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
