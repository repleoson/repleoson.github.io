And will he seek to reform and modernise or will he maintain &amp;lsquo;business as usual'?  In the coming and going between the faithful and the faithless, we examine how the battle for hearts, minds and souls, is more than just a numbers game.  Joining us in Vatican City to discuss the present issues and future direction for the Roman Catholic Church are: Marco Tosatti, writer for La Stampa, and author of several books on religion, including John Paul II: Portrait of a Pontiff; Father Norman Tanner, a Jesuit Priest, and author of New Short History of the Catholic Church; and Marco Politi, a journalist and author of Joseph Ratzinger - Crisis of a Papacy.<br /><br />At Al Jazeera English, we focus on people and events that affect people's lives.
