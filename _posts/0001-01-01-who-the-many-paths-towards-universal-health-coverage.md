{% raw %}At some point in their lives, everyone needs health care....but today not everyone has access to the care that they need.<br /><br />Universal health coverage ensures that all people get the health services they need without suffering financial hardship.  The goal of moving towards universal health coverage is gaining momentum around the world.<br /><br />This video, produced by the World Health Organization, explains the concept of universal coverage and uses examples from six countries -- China, Oman, Mexico, Rwanda, Thailand and Turkey -- to show ways that all countries can provide accessible and affordable care for their people. <br /><br />For more information: <br />www.who.int/universal_health_coverage{% endraw %}
