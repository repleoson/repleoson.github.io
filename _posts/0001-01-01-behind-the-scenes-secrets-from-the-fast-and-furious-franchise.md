{% raw %}What You Did Not Know About The Fast And Furious Franchise<br />Subscribe to our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant</a><br /><br />We are used to seeing over the top car chases and gravity-defying stunts in the famous Fast and the Furious franchise, but do you know how many cars have been destroyed in the process? We will fill you in on some of the numbers, and check out some other behind the scenes info that most fans probably don’t know about. The train heist is one of the most expensive movie moments out there, mostly because of one big ticket item. Famous driver Keiichi Tsuchiya made a cameo in Tokyo Drift, and Ryan Reynolds came up with a lot of his own dialogue in Hobbs &amp; Shaw. Some sources say there’s a deleted scene between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham that Vin Diesel had destroyed for one particular reason. Although Charlize Theron is amazing as Cipher, she and her kissing co-star disagree on how good their on screen smooch really was. We’ll also go over some of the biggest stunts so far, including the airplane scene and ice chase. <br /><br />What do you think about the future of this fan-favorite franchise? Do you hope we have a lot more movies to look forward to, or do you think it’s time for this chapter in cinema history to finally come to a close?
