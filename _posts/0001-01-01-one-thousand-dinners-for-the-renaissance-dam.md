{% raw %}Yesterday, a fundraising event organised by the Ethiopian Embassy in collaboration with #GERD Support Network UK and Ireland, saw more than 1,000 members of the Ethiopian Community from all walks of life come together to raise vital funds for the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). The event, which was held under the theme “One Thousand Dinners for the Renaissance Dam”, reaffirmed the commitment and unity of the Ethiopian community in the UK towards #Ethiopia’s development endeavours. <br />Speaking on the occasion, Ambassador Teferi Melesse Desta applauded the #diaspora for their ongoing support towards Ethiopia’s development efforts and reform process, and called upon them to further enhance their support by continuing engaging with the Embassy’s plans and activities. He also commended the organising committee for their tireless efforts towards making this timely event happen. <br />All proceeds from ticket sales and money raised at the event will go towards the completion of the GERD. <br />Full coverage of the event will be available on our YouTube page soon.{% endraw %}
