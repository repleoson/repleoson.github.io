{% raw %}What IRCC accepts as proof of Funds?<br />Funds must be readily available to you. For example, you can't use gold or equity on real property as proof of settlement funds.<br /><br />You also can’t borrow this money from another person. You must be able to use this money to pay the costs of living for your family (even if they aren’t coming with you).<br /><br />If your spouse is coming with you, you can count the money you have together in a joint account. You may be able to count money in an account under their name only, but you must prove you have access to the money.<br /><br />The funds must be available both when you apply and when (if) we issue you a permanent resident visa. You must prove to an immigration officer that you can legally access the money to use here when you arrive.<br /><br />For proof, you must get official letters from any banks or financial institutions where you’re keeping money.<br /><br />Official IRCC Link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/proof-funds.html">https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/proof-funds.html</a><br /><br />🔆🔆To book an appointment with ICCRC licensed immigration consultant use this link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://askkubeir.com/appointment">http://askkubeir.com/appointment</a><br /><br />🔆🔆To avail of our paid premium services, use this link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://askkubeir.com/our-services">https://askkubeir.com/our-services</a><br /><br />📢 Our Social Media Links:<br />▶️Facebook Group: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/askkubeir">http://www.facebook.com/groups/askkubeir</a><br />▶️Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/askkubeir">http://www.facebook.com/askkubeir</a><br />🐥Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AskKubeir">https://twitter.com/AskKubeir</a><br />🎵 TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@askkubeir">https://www.tiktok.com/@askkubeir</a><br />🎬 Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kubeirkamal">https://www.instagram.com/kubeirkamal</a>  (Follow me for Tip of the Day!!!)<br />🎯 Website: www.askkubeir.com<br /><br />Video Tags:<br />Canada Immigration, Life in Canada, Ask Kubeir, Canadian Immigration, Skilled Worker, Canada PR Update, Canada Visa Update, Easy Canada PR, Immigrate to Canada, Study Abroad, International Students in Canada, Canada Visa News, Canada Immigration Channel, Canada Visa News, Canada Immigration Update, Express Entry Draw, Express Entry Update, Canada PR Program Update{% endraw %}
