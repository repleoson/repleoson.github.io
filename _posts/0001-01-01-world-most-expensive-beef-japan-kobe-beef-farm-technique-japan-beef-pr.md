{% raw %}KOBE beef is one of the world’s premium foods. The value is so high that it can be said that.  You are lucky to try it once in your life. Kobe beef comes from Tajima-gyu cattle, and has to go through rigorous screenings and checks to ensure that it is proper Kobe beef. Firstly, the cow itself must be a purebred Japanese Black steer (castrated bull) or virgin cow from the Tajima-gyu lineage. The animal must be born and raised exclusively in the Hyogo Prefecture of Japan and can only be fed grains and grasses from that prefecture. The slaughtering has to be done within the prefecture as well, and the cow has to have a weight of 470kg or less upon carcass weighing.<br /><br />Credit :<br />竹福 新鮮熟成和牛<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.takefuku-online.com/">https://www.takefuku-online.com/</a><br /><br />山勇牛一貫<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hida-yamayuushi.com/">https://hida-yamayuushi.com/</a><br /><br />西九州食財<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nishi-kyushusyokuzai.jp/">https://nishi-kyushusyokuzai.jp/</a><br /><br />If you are the owner, send me a comment on the video.
