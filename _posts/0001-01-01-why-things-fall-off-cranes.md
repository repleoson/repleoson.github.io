And, like all human endeavors, rigging is prone to error. Some of the most serious crane failures in history had nothing to do with the crane itself but were actually a result of poor rigging. There‚Äôs a lot that can go wrong below the hook, so in this video, we‚Äôre going to take a look at a few of the fundamentals in attaching and securing a load and some of the hidden hazards that can pop up if not done properly and carefully.<br /><br />Practical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.
