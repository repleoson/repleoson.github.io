{% raw %}&quot;The Encompassing Which We Are and Every Particular Horizon Enclosed&quot; video by Justine Reimnitz. Sound by Bryan Teoh. Produced at Lawrence University 2006. <br /><br />The Encompassing is not a horizon within which every determinate mode of Being and Truth emerges for us, but rather that as in something absolutely comprehensive which is no longer visible as a horizon at all.{% endraw %}
