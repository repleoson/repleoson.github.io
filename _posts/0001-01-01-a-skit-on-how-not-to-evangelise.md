{% raw %}A skit by the ladies on how NOT TO evangelise and they show how they absolutely take no heed to the Holy, Spirit promptings. <br />If you do not listen to what the Lord is trying to show you about a person, you will miss the mark altogether and people will leave with the same problem they came with and added on top of that they will sometimes be resentful of Christians because we just added to their hurt. James 1:19 says “Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:”  LISTEN and be led by the Holy Spirit for it says in Romans 8:14<br />For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.<br /><br />God bless you and hope you find not only the humour but also the seriousness in this message.{% endraw %}
