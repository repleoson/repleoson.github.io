{% raw %}Wondering how to practice self love? Self love is more than just changing your hair, getting a new wardrobe, or attempting to redefine yourself. Self love is obtaining an appreciation for yourself that stems from the physical, emotional, and spiritual support you provide yourself. It's not a fixed state, but it grows through actions that lead to maturity over time. Self care encompasses four different partsâ€“ self awareness, self worth, self esteem, and self care.
