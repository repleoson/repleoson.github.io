{% raw %}SATSANG OF THE WEEK<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.tv/satsang-of-the-week">https://mooji.tv/satsang-of-the-week</a><br /><br />Mooji takes us through the simplicity and power of learning to observe. The more we place importance on this conscious looking and stay in our silence, the less we enter the noise of the mind. <br /><br />“We all need to learn to observe more than to go with our reactions. The power is in staying as the Self. This is natural for everybody, it is here in you right now. <br /><br />You’re coming back into your immeasurable being.”<br /><br /><br />~<br /><br />This video is the ‘Satsang of the Week’ for 1 November 2020<br />Watch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.tv/satsang-of-the-week">https://mooji.tv/satsang-of-the-week</a><br />Subscribe for weekly notifications: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.org/subscribe-satsang-of-the-week">https://mooji.org/subscribe-satsang-of-the-week</a><br /><br />More recent, potent talks available on Sahaja Express:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.tv/subscription">https://mooji.tv/subscription</a><br /><br />If you would like to support the sharing of Satsang, you can donate here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.org/donate?tcode=mtv7">https://mooji.org/donate?tcode=mtv7</a><br /><br />#Mooji #satsang #spirituality #advaita #nonduality #awakening{% endraw %}
