{% raw %}#woodcarving #beginnerwoodcarving #5minutewizard This is my take on Tom Hindes 5 minute wizard.What i like about this carving is that once you get the gist of the cuts you can apply them in all kinds of ways using different mediums from sticks to pencils and still end up with a very satisfying outcome.I did not know what to name this video so although the title may seem alittle clickbaity I truly believe this is something that anyone can do and get almost immediate results that will only build confidence in all carvers alike -hope you like it and a big thanks for watchin<br />-if you are new to woodcarving I have several videos on getting started and tool/wood selection that may help you on your way <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/douglinker">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/douglinker</a>{% endraw %}
