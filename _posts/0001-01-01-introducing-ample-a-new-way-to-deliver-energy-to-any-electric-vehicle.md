{% raw %}Accelerating the transition to electric mobility by offering an energy delivery solution that is as fast, as simple, and as convenient as gas. Ample uses Modular Battery Swapping to deliver a full charge (100%) in under 10 minutes, 3 times faster than charging. It works with any electric vehicle and dramatically reduces the cost and time it takes to install EV infrastructure. Ample's system is designed for rapid deployment, making it possible to equip an entire metropolitan area with a ubiquitous network in a matter of weeks, while delivering energy at a cost as cheap as gasoline. Ample has the additional benefit of being able to capture wind and solar power when itâ€™s available, and then dispense that energy to EVs when needed.{% endraw %}
