{% raw %}I've always wanted to see the top pro surfers' pop-up technique in slow motion, so when I had the opportunity to shoot the WSL Founder's Cup at Kelly Slater's Surf Ranch, I rented a long lense and started shooting 120fps, which I then slowed down 5x for this video. I found it really interesting, so I decidedto share it so we could all learn from it. I was surprised that there were so many different techniques among these best. Tell me what you see here. What surprises you? Whose technique looks best to you?<br /><br />Obviously, we're just seeing their popups on a small-ish right-hand wave. They would adjust their technique in different types of surf (larger, steeper waves, etc), but the wave pool gave us a rare opportunity to see how their pop ups differ when they're all on the exact same wave. <br /><br />If you want to see some of my photos from the event, scroll back in my instagram: www.instagram.com/brentdangerrose<br /><br />Music by: Kevin MacLeod of Incompetech <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://incompetech.com/">https://incompetech.com/</a>{% endraw %}
