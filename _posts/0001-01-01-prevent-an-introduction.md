{% raw %}Groomers of all kinds prey on feelings of stress and isolation to exploit vulnerable individuals, both online and offline. #Prevent protects individuals targeted by terrorist influences by providing local, multi-agency safeguarding support. This video gives an introduction to how Prevent works on the ground, told by those who have come into contact with the programme. <br /><br />Anyone can make a referral to Prevent. If you are concerned that someone you know is at risk of radicalisation, you can call the police on 101 to get advice or share a concern so that they can get support. Alternatively, you can contact your Local Authority safeguarding team: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council</a><br /><br />For further information on digital safety at this time:<br /><br />Letâ€™s Talk About It: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ltai.info/staying-safe-online/">https://www.ltai.info/staying-safe-online/</a><br />Educate Against Hate: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://educateagainsthate.com/parents/">https://educateagainsthate.com/parents/</a><br />Support for parents and carers to keep children safe online: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-keeping-children-safe-online/coronavirus-covid-19-support-for-parents-and-carers-to-keep-children-safe-online">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-keeping-children-safe-online/coronavirus-covid-19-support-for-parents-and-carers-to-keep-children-safe-online</a>{% endraw %}
