{% raw %}Hey, guys! Today’s video, sponsored by Cotton Incorporated, is all about how you can get the best night’s sleep of your life aka some awesome sleep hacks! <br /><br />Many of you have been asking since the channel began for me to make a video that helps you fall asleep and stay asleep. Insomnia is a huge problem and I totally understand that. There are also a ton of how to fall asleep faster or how to stay asleep videos out there but I feel too many of them are not evidence-based nor even really expert based. <br /><br />These sleep routine tips and bedroom hacks, including swapping out synthetic for cotton sheets, will help you get the ZZZZZs you need to take on the day; and the best part is that the power to improve your sleep and beat your insomnia is right in your hands! <br /><br />Just so you know I can talk about sleep for hours so if there is a specific question of yours on sleep that has been left unanswered please jump into the comments section and I will do my best to respond right there or in my monthly responding to comments video!  <br /><br />If you have a topic you would like for me to create a dedicated video on, please let me know because I take your requests seriously. We will be back with more Medical Drama Review Series in a couple of weeks so please submit more names of shows/episodes you'd like for me to watch. Love you all! <br /><br />- Doctor Mike Varshavski<br /><br />Please SUBSCRIBE for new videos every Sunday 11am EST ▶  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/87kYq6">https://goo.gl/87kYq6</a> <br /><br />Let’s connect:<br /><br />Patreon <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/doctormike">https://www.patreon.com/doctormike</a><br />IG <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/41ZS7w">https://goo.gl/41ZS7w</a> - Doctor Mike<br />Reddit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DoctorMike/">https://www.reddit.com/r/DoctorMike/</a><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/kzmGs5">https://goo.gl/kzmGs5</a> - Real Doctor Mike<br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/QH4nJS">https://goo.gl/QH4nJS</a> - Real Doctor Mike<br /><br />Contact Email: DoctorMikeMedia@Gmail.com<br /><br />Sources for further reading: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thefabricofourlives.com/learn-about-cotton/the-benefits-of-cotton">https://thefabricofourlives.com/learn-about-cotton/the-benefits-of-cotton</a> <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4853167/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4853167/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sleepfoundation.org/bedroom/touch.php">https://sleepfoundation.org/bedroom/touch.php</a> <br /><br /><br />** The information in this video is not intended or implied to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.
