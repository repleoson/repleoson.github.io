After completing the &quot;Flight Attendant&quot; Aviator Harness training course, they were able to teach their parrots to skillfully and willingly put on the harness to go outside. Watch how well a Blue and Gold Macaw, Green Winged Macaw, African Grey, Amazon, and Senegal Parrot put on their Aviator Harnesses. This video was recorded at the 2018 annual convention of the German Aviator Club near Frankfurt. <br /><br />You too can learn how to train your parrot to successfully wear a harness by following the Parrot Wizard's Guide to Well-Behaved Parrots and Harness Training DVD:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ParrotWizard.com/Book">http://ParrotWizard.com/Book</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ParrotWizard.com/Harness_DVD">http://ParrotWizard.com/Harness_DVD</a><br /><br />Get an Aviator Harness Leash for your parrot:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ParrotWizard.com/Harness">http://ParrotWizard.com/Harness</a><br /><br />Browse Hundreds of Parrot Wizard Videos:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ParrotWizard.com/Videos">http://ParrotWizard.com/Videos</a><br /><br />To join the German Flight club and follow the Aviator Harness Training Webinars:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://AviatorFlightClub.com">https://AviatorFlightClub.com</a>{% endraw %}
