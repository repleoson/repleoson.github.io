It wouldn’t be reasonable to have to spend lots of money on plant and equipment to further reduce what is already a low risk.<br /><br />On the other hand, if we have a high frequency task that presents a significant risk to our employee/s. It starts to make sense to apply resources toward mitigating that risk.<br /><br />The expectation is that we try our best to get the risk as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP). OK, but what does this look like in practice?{% endraw %}
