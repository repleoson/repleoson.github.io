{% raw %}RELEASED: 23.10.15 (Beatport)<br /><br />2015 has been a hell of a year for this UK based House duo with all major labels falling over themselves to pick up their next EP. All top-flight DJ’s are also taking notice including Pete Tong who provides regular Radio One support and as an extra string to their musical bow, CamelPhat now debut on Toolroom.<br /><br />Both tracks on this EP were the result of a studio session that came after a 4-day marathon in    Ibiza with very little sleep and various trips to DC-10. Those techy drums, low-slung basslines and sleazy synths reek of the White Isle at 10am on a Monday morning. So, if it’s hot and sweaty beats you are after then look no further. ‘Get Sick’ is a peak-time tech-houser whilst ‘Luna’ delves into darker techno territory but both are welcomed additions to any discerning USB stick!<br /><br />www.facebook.com/toolroomrecords <br />www.toolroomrecords.com <br />www.youtube.com/toolroomrecords   <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.beatport.com/label/toolroom/495">http://www.beatport.com/label/toolroom/495</a><br /><br />Coming soon….<br /><br />Subscribe here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/subscribe2Toolroom">http://bit.ly/subscribe2Toolroom</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.toolroomrecords.com">http://www.toolroomrecords.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.beatport.com/label/toolroom-records/495">http://www.beatport.com/label/toolroom-records/495</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/toolroomrecords">https://www.facebook.com/toolroomrecords</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/toolroomrecords">https://twitter.com/toolroomrecords</a>{% endraw %}
