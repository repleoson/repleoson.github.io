{% raw %}SUBSCRIBE to Truly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj">http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj</a><br /><br />16-YEAR OLD teen mum Macey from Atlanta, Georgia was just 14 when she found out that she was pregnant and expecting her first child. “When I found out I was pregnant it was hard to process, I was really shocked,” Macey told Truly. With a mum and grandmother who were both teen mums themselves, Macey’s family were worried about the impact this would have on her. And even Macey herself had her doubts: “I didn’t really think I was cut out to be a mum, I didn’t really want kids and used to judge teen mums.” However, the highschool freshman decided to keep her baby and Macey gave birth to her daughter Scarlett last year. Macey has been documenting her experiences as a teen mum online to support other young mums. Whilst she receives huge amounts of support on her social media platforms, she has also faced a lot of judgment and negativity. “I received a lot of hate when I was pregnant, I had people drag my name through the mudd.” Determined not to let the negativity get to her, Macey continues to share her story and today she’s meeting her cousin Taylor to take some pictures for social media. <br /><br />Follow Macey here:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/maceyyburnett/">https://www.instagram.com/maceyyburnett/</a> <br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@maceyyburnett">https://www.tiktok.com/@maceyyburnett</a> <br /><br />Videographer: Michael Catron<br />Producers:  Stephanie Stijkel, Ruby Coote <br />Editor: Giulia Bassanese <br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
