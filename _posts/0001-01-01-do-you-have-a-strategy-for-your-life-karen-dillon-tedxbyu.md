{% raw %}No one aspires to a life of unhappiness. But that’s exactly the strategy we so often unwittingly pursue. Here’s how to avoid that fate. Karen Dillon has been named by Ashoka as one of the world's most influential and inspiring women. The former Editor of Harvard Business Review, Dillon coauthored the New York Times bestseller How Will You Measure Your Life? with Harvard professor Clayton Christensen and coauthored the forthcoming book The Prosperity Paradox: How Innovation Can Lift Nations out of Poverty with Christensen and Efosa Ojomo. She is the editorial director of BanyanGlobal Family Business Advisors and a senior researcher of global prosperity for the Clayton Christensen Institute. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
