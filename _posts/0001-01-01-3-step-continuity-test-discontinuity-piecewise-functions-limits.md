{% raw %}This calculus video tutorial explains how to identify points of discontinuity or to prove a function is continuous / discontinuous at a point by using the 3 step continuity test.  This involves evaluating piecewise functions using one sided limits.  The first step is to determine if the function is defined at the given point.  The second step is to prove that the limit exists by showing that the right side equals the left side.  If the limit does not exist, it could be a jump discontinuity or an infinite discontinuity which are nonremovable.  The 3rd step is to show that the limit equals the function at the given point.  If the limit exists but does not equal the function, then it's a point discontinuity also known as a hole which is removable.<br /><br />Ten Side Hustles For College Students<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.video-tutor.net/side-hustles.html">https://www.video-tutor.net/side-hustles.html</a><br /><br />How To Pass Difficult Math &amp; Science Classes:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3B9c08z">https://amzn.to/3B9c08z</a><br />Video Playlists:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.video-tutor.net">https://www.video-tutor.net</a><br />Homework Help:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Find-A-Tutor">https://bit.ly/Find-A-Tutor</a><br /><br />Subscribe:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/37WGgXl">https://bit.ly/37WGgXl</a><br />Support &amp; Donations:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor">https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor</a><br />Youtube Membership:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWpbFLzoYGPfuWUMFPSaoA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWpbFLzoYGPfuWUMFPSaoA/join</a><br /><br />Disclaimer:  Some of the links associated with this video may generate affiliate commissions on my behalf.
