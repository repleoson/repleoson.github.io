Like, your kid is supposed to know that he shouldn’t run the tap while he is brushing his teeth because that way he will be wasting water. On the other hand, your little one should be educated about how he can make the Earth a cleaner place to live in by throwing the garbage in the bins instead of on the roads and streets. <br /><br />Your child must also be educated on keeping the air clean by preventing air pollution and the causes of air pollution. Long story short, your little one must know about saving Earth’s resources once you start teaching him the other basics of maths, English and other subjects. The best part is that you can make it fun for your child to learn about how to conserve natural resources. For starters, you can make him watch online Youtube tutorials, you can opt for online courses and you can even play different games and read stories to fit the concept in your little one’s brain that he/she is supposed to be a good citizen and add to the Earth’s development. <br /><br />One of the best ways to teach your child about conserving the natural resources is to buy him a bike and then show him the benefits of opting for a bike instead of a car. You see, these small things and these small practical examples will add a lot to his brain and he will hence understand how the conservation occurs in the first place. <br /><br /><br /><br />Subscribe to our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/iG2Bdr">https://goo.gl/iG2Bdr</a><br /><br />#TalentedAndGifted #LearnWithKidsAcademy<br /><br />Kids Academy Talented and Gifted Program for kids aged 2-10: <br /><br />*****<br /><br />Connect with us on :<br /><br />App Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://smart.link/59833db06a6b8">https://smart.link/59833db06a6b8</a><br />Google Play: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://smart.link/597210af6eb83">https://smart.link/597210af6eb83</a><br /><br />Our website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.kidsacademy.mobi">http://www.kidsacademy.mobi</a><br />Facebook:      <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/KidsAcademyC...">https://www.facebook.com/KidsAcademyC...</a><br />Twitter:           <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/KidsAcademyCo">https://twitter.com/KidsAcademyCo</a>{% endraw %}
