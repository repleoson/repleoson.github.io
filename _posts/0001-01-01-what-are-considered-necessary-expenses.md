{% raw %}NCAA Eligibility Center <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.athleticscholarships.net/ncaa-eligibility-center.htm">http://www.athleticscholarships.net/ncaa-eligibility-center.htm</a><br /><br />To maintain your amateur athlete status before you enter college, there are several rules you need to follow.<br /><br />It's important to know these rules if you plan on competing at a college or university. One of the rules that the NCAA enforces involves accepting money from a sports team or organization. This money can come in the form of a stipend, prize money, or endorsements.<br /><br />In order to remain eligible to be cleared by the NCAA, high school athletes cannot accept money or other benefits whose total exceeds necessary expenses needed for their sport or team.<br /><br />The NCAA stipulates that high school athletes &quot;may not receive expenses from an outside amateur sports team or organization in excess of actual and necessary travel, room and board expenses, and apparel and equipment...&quot;. If you accept anything more than what is considered necessary expenses for your sport or team, your amateur status may be in jeopardy.<br /><br />If you violate your amateur status, then you will not be cleared to compete in college.{% endraw %}
