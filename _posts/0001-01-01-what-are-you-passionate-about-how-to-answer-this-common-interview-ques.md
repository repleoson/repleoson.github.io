It also tells them you can be COMMITTED to one thing, and see it through to the end! <br /><br />3 TIPS FOR ANSWERING THE INTERVIEW QUESTION, WHAT ARE YOU PASSIONATE ABOUT?<br />TIP #1. Give more than one thing that you are passionate about in your life. You could be passionate about lots of things – it could be work-related, a sport or physical activity, a pastime, or even a worthy cause or charity.<br /><br />TIP #2. And, this is key when answering the interview question, what are you passionate about? Include in your answer a positive OUTCOME from your passion. <br /><br />So, you could say… “I am very passionate about playing the guitar. I taught myself how to play by following online YouTube tutorials, and my goal was to always be able to play in a band. I actually achieved that goal last month when I did my first gig. It was a great feeling to be able to go from never having picked up a guitar before to doing a live gig in a relatively short space of time.”<br /><br />That answer tells the hiring manager you set yourself goals, you apply yourself, and you follow things through until the end… i.e. there is a positive OUTCOME from your passion!<br /><br />TIP #3. Is a very simple tip, but still very important… and that is to talk with PASSION and ENTHUSIASM when you are giving your answer!<br /><br />HERE ARE 2 GREAT EXAMPLE ANSWERS TO THE INTERVIEW QUESTION, WHAT ARE YOU PASSIONATE ABOUT?<br />SAMPLE ANSWER OPTION #1 02:45<br /><br />SAMPLE ANSWER OPTION #2 03:42<br /><br />MORE USEFUL JOB INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS TRAINING VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE BY RICHARD MCMUNN:<br />Interview questions and answers: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/KCm6JVtoRdo">https://youtu.be/KCm6JVtoRdo</a><br />How to introduce yourself in a job interview: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/wexzvClUcUk">https://youtu.be/wexzvClUcUk</a><br />What's your biggest weakness? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/UX_dxcjp5Gw">https://youtu.be/UX_dxcjp5Gw</a><br />What are your strengths? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/gCJsGsZ3hhU">https://youtu.be/gCJsGsZ3hhU</a><br /><br />CONNECT WITH RICHARD MCMUNN ON LINKEDIN.COM:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-mcmunn-coach/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-mcmunn-coach/</a><br /><br />*****************************************************************<br />✅ DOWNLOAD RICHARD MCMUNN'S 50 GREAT ANSWERS TO COMMON INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://passmyinterview.com/50-interview-questions-and-answers/">https://passmyinterview.com/50-interview-questions-and-answers/</a><br />***********************************************************************{% endraw %}
