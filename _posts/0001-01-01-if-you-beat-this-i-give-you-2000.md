A set seed is allowed ONLY if the portal isn't fully filled in. My plugin HAS to be the only plugin that is enabled. GOODLUCK<br /><br />#Fundy #Minecraft #ImpossibleDifficulty<br /><br />now the word soup:<br /><br />In this video I dont play on the DreamSMP, but instead I made one of my babymode difficulties, or impossible difficulties. It makes minecraft impossible in the hopes of a minecraft, but video like dream / dreamwastaken or george / georgenotfound or tommyinnit or wilbur or other dream smp members have done in the past. I coded it so that minecraft is actually impossible, and this is a custom difficulty / challenge / minecraft but for you to try out! I hope you enjoy this fun little project, it was a blast to record and make, and I definitely did enjoy it. I hope you have fun watching!{% endraw %}
