{% raw %}Sometimes the best way to understand something complicated and abstract is with a metaphor. Gareth Morgan suggested we can gain some good insights into the nature of organizations from 8 organizational metaphors. <br /><br />Watching this video is worth 2 Management Courses CPD Points*.<br />(See below for more details)<br /><br />The Nature of Organizations<br />=======================<br />This video is part of course module number 6.1.1<br /> Program 6: Managing within Organizations<br /> Course 1: The Nature of Organizations<br /> Section 1: Introduction to Organizations<br /><br /><br />Other videos in this section include:<br />- What is an Organization? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/bfqubYe8YNA">https://youtu.be/bfqubYe8YNA</a><br />- Organizations as Structures: Understanding an Organization as a Structure <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/LLnoTLkapjo">https://youtu.be/LLnoTLkapjo</a><br />- Organizations as Processes: Understanding an Organization as a Set of Processes <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/i51iHWLB3hE">https://youtu.be/i51iHWLB3hE</a><br />- The Features of Organizations: What an Organization Needs <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/vVwryqV92KE">https://youtu.be/vVwryqV92KE</a><br />- Why do we need Organizations?

They each give complementary perspectives:<br />1. Machines<br />A mechanistic view of organizations that stresses process and efficiency. Possibly at the cost of poor human relations and lower agility.<br />2. Organisms<br />Living systems adapt to their environments. But if they fail to adapt, they fail to thrive.<br />3. Brains<br />Rationality, learning and creativity. Stress the role of organizations as information processors.<br />4. Cultures<br />Sees organizations as a collection of values, beliefs, traditions, and rituals that provide distinctness.<br />5. Political Systems<br />A view that stresses the roles of interests, agendas, influence, alliances and, of course, power. <br />6. Psychic Prisons<br />Perceiving organizations as systems that repress and restrain members, due to conscious and unconscious pressures.<br />7. Flux and Transformation<br />Organizations are a platform for changes that can be adaptive or chaotic.<br />8. Instruments of Domination<br />Organizations are a means to overcome and dominate competitors â€“ socially, economically, or politically. <br /><br />RECOMMENDED EXERCISE<br />======================<br />Think about organizations where you have worked, or that you have encountered and know quite well. <br />1.
