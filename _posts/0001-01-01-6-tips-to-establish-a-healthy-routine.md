{% raw %}The Best Tips to Establish A Healthy  Routine | Sanne Vloet<br /><br />Hello my lovely friends! <br /><br />I hope everyone is doing well! I have missed you! Apologies for the late video this month but my hard drive crashed with lots of footage! A company is now trying to recover it so hopefully it will be all good soon! I really wanted to make this video for you because this is a topic I find very helpful! My trip in Europe was so much fun but after I came back I noticed I had to make some changes after all the party, food and travels haha. <br /><br />These tips are super helpful for me and can really help you to feel your best! Also, are you excited for Wellness Month in November?<br /><br />Big hugs Sanne<br /><br />Follow me!<br />Instagram: @sannevloet (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2vlnHLy)">https://bit.ly/2vlnHLy)</a><br />Twitter: @sannevloet (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2OKggYH)">https://bit.ly/2OKggYH)</a><br />Subscribe!!! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2KzihS5">https://bit.ly/2KzihS5</a><br /><br />Follow the link to my gear page with everything I use to create content - B&amp;H Photo - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bhpho.to/34XSsaj">https://bhpho.to/34XSsaj</a><br /><br />Music: <br />I used music from Epidemic Sound -  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/GVgBV">http://share.epidemicsound.com/GVgBV</a><br />I used music from Music Bed - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.mscbd.fm/sannevloet">http://share.mscbd.fm/sannevloet</a>{% endraw %}
