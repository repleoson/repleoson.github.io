{% raw %}Hey Gorgeous, would you like a Girlfriend or Wifey Allowance? Maybe you should share this video with your man, it might get you that allowance haha...<br /><br />Anyway on a very real note, is the girlfriend or wifey allowance a real thing? Should it be a must in a relationship? For som ladies, they can't move on in a relationship without that &quot;helping hand&quot; and others don't want a single penny from the man. <br /><br />I've received money from my man before, it wasn't a regular thing, it didn't happen every month or every week but he gave me money to spend spoil myself, now does that count as a wifey allowance?<br /><br />Men like to spend on women and it's not uncommon to get offered an allowance, would you accept? If no why not? And is yes, then what would you do with it?<br /><br />Today's one is going to be interesting.<br />Enjoy<br />Kopano*<br /><br />#CheleteTuesday #GirlfriendAllowance #WifeyAllowance<br />. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br />Let's Connect and Keep the Conversation Going <br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://kopanotheblog.co.za/">http://kopanotheblog.co.za/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kopanoshimange/">https://www.instagram.com/kopanoshimange/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/KopanoShimange">https://twitter.com/KopanoShimange</a><br />Email: info@kopanotheblog.co.za{% endraw %}
