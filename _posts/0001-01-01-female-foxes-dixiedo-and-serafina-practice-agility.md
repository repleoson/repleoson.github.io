{% raw %}Most canines can really benefit from being given tasks, jobs, and tricks to do. It helps keep them from becoming bored and usually for them it's really fun and exciting. <br /><br />Boredom can cause anxiety and destructive behaviors. <br /><br />When we get foxes in that are around 6 months or younger they are at the perfect age for trick training and leash training. I at least attempt this with the foxes. Not all foxes are into being walked or learning tricks and if that's the case I don't force them. Then we need to come up with other ways to keep them busy.{% endraw %}
