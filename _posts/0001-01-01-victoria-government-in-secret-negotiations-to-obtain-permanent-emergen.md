{% raw %}Victorian Liberal Democrats MP David Limbrick says if the Victorian government tries to introduce permanent state of emergency powers it should be done with wide consultation and not &quot;behind closed doors&quot; with parliamentary crossbenchers.<br /><br />Mr Limbrick alluded to an article in one of the Nine papers which reported the Victorian government was in secret negotiations with the three crossbenchers who supported their extensions of state of emergency powers, to introduce laws, permanent 'pandemic laws', to replace the state of emergency.<br /><br />&quot;If we're going to have these permanent emergency powers like surely there should be wide consultation with people who care about human rights and the freedoms of Victorians,&quot; Mr Limbrick said.<br /><br />&quot;It sounds like they're just doing secret deals behind closed doors to come up with god knows what.<br /><br />&quot;What I want to see is a deadline. I'd love to see the Victorian government cooperate with the federal government and set a date, that's what everyone needs here I think.<br /><br />&quot;December 4th it's the first weekend of summer ... up until that point make sure that everyone who wants to get vaccines can get them ... everyone who chooses to have one can have one, they get ready with their medical systems.<br /><br />&quot;Then on December 4th all of the restrictions, all of the emergency powers get wiped, they just get turned off.&quot;{% endraw %}
