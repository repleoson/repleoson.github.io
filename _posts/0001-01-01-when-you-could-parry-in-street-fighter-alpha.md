{% raw %}Hyper Street Fighter Alpha was an additional mode included in Street Fighter Alpha Anthology on the PS2. It included 'Street Fighter 3-ISM' mode that allowed characters to parry. <br /><br />There were other ISMs that gave the characters some new moves, such as Ken's air fireball and Guy's teleport. I've tried to include a bunch of them here.<br /><br />If you want to support my channel...<br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/biffotasty">https://www.patreon.com/biffotasty</a><br /><br />Check out my band:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1KjHshYijC-24WtJvxnNdw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1KjHshYijC-24WtJvxnNdw</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://projectdolphin.bandcamp.com">https://projectdolphin.bandcamp.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DolphinOST">https://twitter.com/DolphinOST</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://megadesk.bandcamp.com/album/capacity">https://megadesk.bandcamp.com/album/capacity</a><br /><br />I've also done an arrange album which you can download for free here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://megadesk.bandcamp.com/album/free-music-vol-1">https://megadesk.bandcamp.com/album/free-music-vol-1</a><br /><br />Or you can buy a T-shirt: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/desk">https://teespring.com/stores/desk</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching.{% endraw %}
