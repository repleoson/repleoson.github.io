{% raw %}Good morning my friends and fiends. It has been a hell of a ride the last little bit and it seems everyone I talk to has been feeling the heaviness but also the overwhelming feeling that something is about to shift. My friend shared this and I took the time to watch it - I think you should too. This could well be the best 3.5 minutes of your day and turn it around for you. The imagery is about physical training but take the message beyond the imagery to whatever challenges are weighing on you. <br /><br />Big hugs, lots of love and let's kick this day in the ass!<br /><br />I don't own this video or imply any rights but felt it far too important to not try to share it's important message out to as many people as can see it. Huge props to Nike, their agents and agencies for this exceptional piece.{% endraw %}
