{% raw %}Jodie Comer was immediately intrigued by “The Last Duel” when she was asked to meet with director Ridley Scott about starring in the period film. While Damon and Affleck teamed up to write the chapters about the men, writer Nicole Holofcener was brought in for Marguerite’s perspective. “I think she brought such a nuance to the script. There’s a lot that can go unsaid between women and there’s a lot that can be said,” Comer said of Holofcener. “I was able to be really open and vulnerable. We were able to do that with each other and speak openly.”<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/VarietySubscribe">http://bit.ly/VarietySubscribe</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/variety">http://www.facebook.com/variety</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/variety">http://www.instagram.com/variety</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/variety">http://www.twitter.com/variety</a>{% endraw %}
