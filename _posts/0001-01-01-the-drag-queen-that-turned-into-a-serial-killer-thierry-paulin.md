I KNOW I SHOULVE BEEN ON IT! i  just know when im done it won't be cool anymore but idk maybe if I watch it really fast ill get a back seat view glimpse of being involved in the conversation before it moves onto the next show. OH I WATCHED TWILIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME! and I may or may not be posting a video about it on my hypothetical vlog channel that might hypothetically be somewhere hidden in this description...OMGG HAILEY!
