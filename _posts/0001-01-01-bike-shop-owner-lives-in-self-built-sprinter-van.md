{% raw %}Check out Mike's &quot;Ultimate Mountain Biker Van&quot; which he built 100% himself and lives in full-time. This thing is fully equipped for long-term riding, digging, living and working. <br /><br />This 2004 Dodge Sprinter Van 3500 complete with heat, running water, solar power and a toilet.<br /><br />He's been living in vans on and off for the past few years, but dreamt of building this exact Sprinter Van while renting a small cabin. He then decided to go for broke and turned his dream into a reality. Living and owning a business in Bellingham, WA means he's in a travel hot-spot on the West Coast, and can pick up and take off anytime to work and live in his home away from home.<br /><br />Buy Mike's Live Gnarly Hoodie @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/y3fgs8yu">https://tinyurl.com/y3fgs8yu</a><br /><br />Diggin' our merch?
