{% raw %}5 Scariest Lovecraftian Monsters<br />Subscribe To Top 5 Scary Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2wZ3UT4">https://bit.ly/2wZ3UT4</a><br /><br />I just love H.P Lovecraft and everything that he spawned, every weird little nuance and horrific tick and twisted cosmic entity that somehow made its way from his strange, uniquely creepy brain, through his pen and down to the page - for all of us to enjoy. I'm going to say it - H.P Lovecraft is the godfather of all things horror. Well - what better way for us all to pay tribute to him, than to scour the bestiary and pick out the creepiest of the creepy. <br /><br />#lovecraft #cthulhu #top5<br /><br />Video Edited By: <br />Ryan Wazonek<br /><br />Hosted By: <br />Jack Finch Instagram: @twocoatsjack{% endraw %}
