{% raw %}What's the difference between further and farther? How do you know when to use &quot;further&quot; or farther&quot; in your sentence? It's actually very easy, and that's what you'll learn in this video! <br /><br />Most people, including native English speakers, are confused by &quot;further&quot; and &quot;farther&quot; and they're not sure which one to use. Many even think that they're interchangeable and it doesn't matter which one you use. <br /><br />There's an easy trick to use to remember if you need &quot;further&quot; or &quot;farther&quot; in your sentence. <br /><br />Use &quot;farther&quot; for physical distance and use &quot;further&quot; for metaphorical/figurative distance. If you're ever in doubt and you're not sure which one to use, use &quot;further&quot;. <br /><br />In this video, we'll review these rules in detail and we'll review example sentences so you can compare &quot;further&quot; and &quot;farther&quot; in a natural context. <br /><br />Please subscribe for more videos to help you learn English and sound like a native English speaker!  <br /><br /><br /><br />Let’s Connect: <br /><br /><br /><br />Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/JForrestEnglish">https://www.facebook.com/JForrestEnglish</a> <br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JForrestEnglish">https://twitter.com/JForrestEnglish</a><br /><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-forrest">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-forrest</a><br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.jforrestenglish.com/">http://www.jforrestenglish.com/</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />Free Guide – Speak English Fluently &amp; Confidently in 6 Easy Steps.
