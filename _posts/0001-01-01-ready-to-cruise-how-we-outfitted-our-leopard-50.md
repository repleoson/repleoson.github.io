{% raw %}Hi everyone! Here is the long awaited final outfitting video for the new Happy Together. We spent 3 months working hard on all the upgrades and extras and it changed daily as field conditions dictated. <br /><br />This is a fun process but a lot of work as well. We have left Florida and are currently cruising the Bahamas to use all these options and get familiar with the boat. <br /><br />We have more videos in store for you as we start to enjoy our time on the Leopard 50!<br /><br />www.svhappytogether.com{% endraw %}
