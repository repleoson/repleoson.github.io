Built on an unsustainable underpinning to ever-increasing debt the financial system is, as far as I am concerned, irretrievably insolvent.<br /><br />To truly grasp this you need to understand the basics of banking and currency (what we call money, but really isn‚Äôt because it doesn‚Äôt satisfy all three necessary preconditions to be called such).  This is briefly covered in this episode.<br /><br />With that basic grounding we can appreciate the vast gap between the claims on true wealth and the amount of true wealth (lots of currency, not as much ‚Äòstuff‚Äô) and now can discuss the immense pain coming to those with fewer resources to combat rapidly rising inflation.<br /><br />Even worse, a true energy emergency in Europe is going to really create a lot of headaches and financial heartaches for a lot of people.  With this essential context you can begin to build up a personal resilience plan to weather it all as best you can.  But it all begins by having the right frame of view and sufficient information and context.<br /><br />Links:<br /><br />Crash Course<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.peakprosperity.com/crashcourse/">https://www.peakprosperity.com/crashcourse/</a><br />Federal Reserve Data<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/</a><br />Money Creation<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.peakprosperity.com/video/crash-course-chapter-7-money-creation-banks/">https://www.peakprosperity.com/video/crash-course-chapter-7-money-creation-banks/</a><br />Global Debt<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/global-debt-hits-record-296-trillion-as-world-lockdowns-ease?sref=ZAnvU9CI">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/global-debt-hits-record-296-trillion-as-world-lockdowns-ease?sref=ZAnvU9CI</a><br /><br />Access to all of Chris‚Äôs content, live webinars twice a month, and much much more is available to our paying members.
