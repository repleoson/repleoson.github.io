{% raw %}The skeleton of a mystery animal was dug up recently by workers in eastern Turkey. It’s about a meter long, and has predatory teeth, as well as especially long hind limbs, and nails, instead of hooves. The work crew contacted researchers from Igdir university, who are going to run tests on the mysterious bones. There’s some undecayed tissue remaining on them, which may allow for a DNA analysis. Ultimately, the skeleton will find a new final resting place in a museum.{% endraw %}
