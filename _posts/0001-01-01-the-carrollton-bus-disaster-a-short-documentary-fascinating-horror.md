{% raw %}On the 14th of May, 1988, a group from the Radcliff First Assembly of God Church spent the day at the Kings Island Amusement Park in Ohio. The trip went well, and when the group piled back onto the church’s yellow school bus in the evening they were exhausted but blissfully happy. As they set off on their return journey, however, they had no idea that the actions of just one man would mean that more than a third of their number would never make it home.<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:40 - Background<br />02:12 - The Accident<br />06:25 - The Aftermath<br /><br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery. Fascinating Horror is all about in-depth research, respectful storytelling, and learning what we can from the mistakes of the past. You might be surprised to discover just how much of today's world is shaped by long-forgotten disasters from decades gone by.<br /><br />Music: &quot;Glass Pond&quot; by Public Memory<br /><br />► Like, comment and subscribe to keep up with my latest videos<br />► Know of an incident I should cover?
