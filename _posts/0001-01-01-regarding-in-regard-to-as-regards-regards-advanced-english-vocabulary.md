{% raw %}In this video, learn advanced English vocabulary and learn how to use &quot;regarding&quot;, &quot;in regard to&quot; and &quot;as regards&quot;. <br /><br />&quot;Regarding&quot;, &quot;in regard to&quot; and &quot;as regards&quot; have the same meaning. They are a formal way of saying &quot;about&quot;. <br /><br />&quot;Regarding&quot; is the most commonly used. <br /><br />If you use &quot;in regard to&quot; make sure you don't say &quot;in regards to&quot;. There is no &quot;s&quot; on &quot;regard&quot;. This is a common mistake that even native speakers make. <br /><br />And if you use '&quot;as regards&quot; make sure there is an &quot;s&quot; on &quot;regards&quot; and there's no preposition &quot;to&quot;. <br /><br />In terms of sentence structure, &quot;regarding&quot;, &quot;in regard to&quot; and &quot;as regards&quot; can be followed by a noun or a gerund verb. <br /><br />By the end of the video, you'll feel confident using &quot;regarding&quot;, &quot;in regard to&quot; and &quot;as regards&quot; in your advanced English vocabulary. <br /><br />Watch the lesson now...<br /><br />Please subscribe for more videos to help you learn English and sound like a native English speaker!  <br /><br />Letâ€™s Connect: <br /><br />Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/JForrestEnglish">https://www.facebook.com/JForrestEnglish</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JForrestEnglish">https://twitter.com/JForrestEnglish</a><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-forrest">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-forrest</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.jforrestenglish.com/">http://www.jforrestenglish.com/</a> <br /><br />Free Speaking Guide - How To Speak English Fluently and Confidently in 6 Easy Steps. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jforrestenglish.com/free-guide/">https://jforrestenglish.com/free-guide/</a>{% endraw %}
