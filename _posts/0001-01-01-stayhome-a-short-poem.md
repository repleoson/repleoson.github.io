{% raw %}I’ve never narrated anything in my life before but after I created the music and footage for this it felt like a poem was the only way to truly convey how I felt. ⠀<br />⠀<br />My mum works for the NHS and has done so for as long as I can remember. I made this for ⁣her, every person who has lost a loved one and every hero who has stood fearlessly on the front line during these treacherous times.⠀⠀<br />⠀⠀<br />R x<br />⠀⠀<br />Follow me on Instagram: @iamrationale<br />⠀⠀<br />Words &amp; Narration: @iamrationale⠀⠀<br />Music: @iamrationale⠀⠀<br />Editing: @iamrationale⠀⠀⠀⠀<br /><br />⠀{% endraw %}
