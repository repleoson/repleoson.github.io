{% raw %}The Mill House is comprised of 3 sections - palm oil, palm kernel oil and briquettes processing.<br /><br />Under a contract awarded by Solidaridad, FINIC built the mill and all the equipment installed in all of its 3 sections.<br /><br />The palm oil section has capacity to process 1 ton of Fresh Fruits Bunches per hour. That will be equivalent to 1,500  litres of oil per day of 8 hours.<br /><br />This video is not a working video but rather, one that shows the equipment layout. The working video will be uploaded later.<br /><br />FINIC IS GOOD FOR AFRICA !<br /><br />Reach us @ +232-76-601956 by Whatsapp in Sierra Leone or +233-264000480 by Whatsapp in Ghana{% endraw %}
