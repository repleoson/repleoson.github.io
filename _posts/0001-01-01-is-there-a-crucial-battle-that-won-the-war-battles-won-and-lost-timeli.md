{% raw %}In Battles Lost and Won, we investigate each crucial battle that decided the resources, territory and strategic advantage of nations at war.<br /><br />Across every theatre of the Second World War battle strategies were designed to capitalise on terrains with better access to supplies. <br /><br />Despite these tactics, many forces were stretched beyond their limits, facing unforeseen conditions and underestimating targets. These battles won and lost would determine possession of territory, resources and the strength to go on fighting. For some of the battles it was the victory that most influenced the future course of the war. <br /><br />For others, it was the defeat. From sweeping offensives to special operations, this is the story of the battles won and battles lost that shaped the outcome of the greatest conflict in history.<br /><br />üì∫  It's like Netflix for history...
