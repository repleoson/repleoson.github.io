{% raw %}Haarp or not? Maybe it's god's will? Please comment below!<br /><br />Heavy rain caused flooding in Bosnia, leading to evacuations and power outages in the capital and flooding of roads in parts of the Balkan country on Friday. In Sarajevo, houses, businesses and local roads were flooded. Schools were flooded in the southwest of the country, causing some schools to cancel classes. Most areas of Sarajevo were left without electricity due to the flooding of one of the main substations on the outskirts of the city. The company that transmits the power said heavy rain is hampering attempts to redirect power. Dozens of people had to be evacuated from their homes in the suburbs of Sarajevo, along the banks of the Bosnia and Tilava rivers. Evacuations are also continuing in the town of Konits, about 50 kilometers southwest of the capital. The rain started late Thursday and is projected to continue until Sunday, raising fears of a repeat of the record flooding that hit about a third of the population in 2014.{% endraw %}
