{% raw %}This is one of those grammar points that drive people crazy. You learn a rule in school e.g. to + infinitive, and later you learn there are exceptions to this rule e.g. look forward to + ....ing. This is the reason why &quot;look forward to&quot; causes so many problems and drives people crazy. But, there's no need to go crazy. Just watch this video and find out all about &quot;look forward to&quot;. <br /><br />If you are interested in doing a business English course or would like business English courses at your company, please get in contact with me:<br />email: neil@neilcollins.de<br /><br />For general information, feel free to visit the website:<br />www.neilcollins.de <br /><br />If you would like more information about Neil Collins or Neil Collins, Business English Training, feel free to click on these links:  <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/neilcollinsberlin">https://de.linkedin.com/in/neilcollinsberlin</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Neil_Collins4?view_mode=preview">https://www.xing.com/profile/Neil_Collins4?view_mode=preview</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BusinessEnglishBerlin/">https://www.facebook.com/BusinessEnglishBerlin/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/irishinberlin">https://twitter.com/irishinberlin</a><br /><br />Former address: <br />Neil Collins Business English Training &amp; Coaching<br />Senefelderstra√üe 15<br />Prenzlauer Berg<br />10437 Berlin<br /><br />Current business address: <br />Neil Collins Business English Training &amp; Coaching<br />c/o Akazien Campus GmbH<br />Akazienstr. 3 a<br />10823 Berlin{% endraw %}
