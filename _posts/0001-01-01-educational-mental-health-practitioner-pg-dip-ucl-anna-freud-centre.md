{% raw %}This video tells you more about this programme, which is a shared initiative between the Department of Education and Department of Health and supports the governmentâ€™s priority to increase access of mental health and wellbeing support for children and young people. The new Education Mental Health Practitioner (EMHP) role is an exciting opportunity to deliver evidence-based early interventions for children and young people in educational settings in England such as schools and colleges. The programme is only available to employees of CYP-IAPT partnerships in London and the South East. This is a UCL-awarded programme, delivered in collaboration with and based at the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families.{% endraw %}
