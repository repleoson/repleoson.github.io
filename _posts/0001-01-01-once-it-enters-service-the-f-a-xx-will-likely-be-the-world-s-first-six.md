{% raw %}latest news<br /><br />The United States Navy just dropped a big hint about its newest F/A-XX sixth-generation fighter in a recently-released U.S. Navy document. <br /><br />The design is unlike any previous U.S. Navy aircraft design. The fighter features canards just to the rear of the cockpit and a novel hybrid delta-lambda wing shape. In contrast to previous F/A-XX concept art that indicated a tailless airframe design, this single image shows a tailed airframe, possibly with ruddervators. However, the image is a bit too low-resolution to be sure.<br /><br />It should be remembered that the image the Navy previewed is a single, not necessarily authoritative, image. Concept art thus far has dramatically changed, from tailless delta wing designs to this newest, potentially tailed airframe design with canards. Modifications—even drastic changes—to what the F/A-XX ultimately looks like should be not anticipated but expected.<br /><br /><br /><br />If useful, make sure to share this video with your friends!<br /><br />__<br /><br />Subscribe for updates:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/DefenseNewsDN?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/DefenseNewsDN?sub_confirmation=1</a>{% endraw %}
