In the video, our robot and the little chicks present a funky choreography on the dance floor, while Mother Hen and the band are singing their hearts out! <br /><br />This song can be used in the classroom or at home to encourage learning through music and body movement. The rhythm, musical arrangement, lyrics, and animation all work together to teach action verbs in the most effective way possible!<br /><br />Young learners of English will also love this video, as it is easy to sing along (lots of lines are short and repeated often) and the words are written and acted out on the screen. <br /><br />Buy the song from iTunes:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/action-song-single/id1065144081">https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/action-song-single/id1065144081</a><br /><br />Buy this video from Sellfy:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sellfy.com/thesingingwalrus">https://sellfy.com/thesingingwalrus</a><br /><br />Here are the lyrics to our Action Song:<br /><br />(Chorus)<br />Naa, naa, naa<br />I'm so happy<br />Oh, so happy<br />Dance/Sing with me<br />(2x)<br /><br />(Verse 1)<br />Clap, clap, clap your hands (kids repeat)<br />Stomp, stomp, stomp your feet (kids repeat)<br />Swing, swing, swing your arms (kids repeat)<br />dance everybody and sing with me!
