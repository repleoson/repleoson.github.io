{% raw %}Today I show you how to make Dalgona Candy. Dalgona candy (also known as Honeycomb candy, Honeycomb Toffee and ppopgi) was recently made popular by the Netflix series Squid Game. Dalgona (달고나) or ppopgi (뽑기) is a Korean candy made with melted sugar and baking soda. It's incredibly easy to make and only takes a couple minutes from start to finish. Simply follow the step by step instructions. This is by far the best homemade Dalgona candy recipe. Enjoy! <br /><br />Have a video Suggestion?
