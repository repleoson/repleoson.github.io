{% raw %}Welcome to Wonderland, where the gobbledygook never ends! This invitation by the Queen of Hearts authorized those with it to attend the first ever dinner at the Mad Hatter's tea party but hosted by the Queen who didn't really invite the Hatter... It's all quite maddening you see. <br /><br />After an exceptional 2 month run and with the extension of 2 additional months for shows. Dinner in Wonderland ran from Dec 16' till Apr 17', the longest Andsoforth production to date. With the enormous responses from parents and children, ANDSOFORTH made the decision on expansion. Presenting the new wing of the company, ANDSOFORTH Junior! Which will bring about a children's show(without the messy food but keeping all the fun in wonderland!) in June 2017. <br /><br />Our first production! ta-dah! ANDSOFORTH Jr. presents Wonderland!
