Phrasal verbs are important because they are extremely common in informal English, and unless one is familiar with their meanings, understanding informal language will be difficult. In addition, learning to use phrasal verbs correctly will help us sound natural in casual conversation.<br /><br />Phrasal verbs are multiword combinations of Verb + Adverb, Verb + Preposition, or Verb + Adverb AND Preposition that function like one-word verbs. They can be transitive or intransitive. One of the most important and challenging characteristics of phrasal verbs is that the meaning of the combination is often quite different from the meaning of the original verb by itself.<br /><br />OPT Phrasal verbs with examples, Phrasal verbs with the word ‘OPT’ that you can use in your daily English conversation to sound like a native speaker.<br /><br />Opt for/to - to choose<br />Opt in/into- to participate<br />Opt out-choose not to participate{% endraw %}
