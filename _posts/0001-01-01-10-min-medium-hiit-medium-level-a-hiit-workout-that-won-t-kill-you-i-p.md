{% raw %}This workout makes you sweat, burns calories… but it won't kill YOU! ♥︎ / Anzeige<br /><br />▸ suitable for Medium Level<br />▸ suitable for Advanced people, who don’t want to push themselves to their absolute limit. I love this as a warm up or in between hardcore videos!  <br />▸ suitable for very motivated Beginners <br /><br />For this routine, I used classic exercises and made them a bit „easier“. <br />= Squats + Tippie Toes instead of Jump Squats<br />= Plank Jump + Walking Jack instead of Plank Jump + Jumping Jack, etc. :) <br /><br />Therefore, I douuuubt you will feel like calling me bad names during those 10min :D Plus, the view &amp; the music are great! <br />We don’t have any Jump Squats or Burpees either :) <br /><br />PS: I filmed this video fully on my own! <br />Camera, tripod, iPhone, timers, exercises, smiling, sunset, hair - that was multitasking at its finest :D <br /><br />__<br /><br />▸ calories burned are between 70-110kcal, depending on your weight, height &amp; fitness level!  I'm a short and tiny person &amp; I burned 70kcal :) <br /><br />The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing 30s for each exercise. If you need a break - TAKE IT! Don't worry too much about that. You will improve over time :) that's the best feeling! <br /><br />__<br /><br />➞ my Pam App ♥︎ Free workout plans (8 versions), lot of recipes &amp; tips: <br />H<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="ttps://www.pam-app.de/app">ttps://www.pam-app.de/app</a><br /><br />▸ 3 of those FREE WORKOUT PLANS are on my Instagram Channel. <br />30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly.
