{% raw %}Leading Edge transmutes the sound influences of 2010s indie folk into a sonic alchemy of pop vocal harmonies, rock-inspired guitar lines, and bluegrass violin elements. With the lyrical introspection of an eternal traveler, the selection produced by Alexander Asp presents a rich palette of instrumental sounds reminiscent of acts like First Aid Kit, The Polyphonic Spree, and Coldplay. The title song &quot;Northern Lights&quot; evokes the experience of witnessing this phenomenon: A union of light and untamed strength.<br /><br />Leading Edge - &quot;Northern Lights&quot;<br />Album: Northern Lights (April 17th, 2020)<br />Label: Rexius Records <br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rexiusrecords.com/artist/leading-edge/">https://www.rexiusrecords.com/artist/leading-edge/</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4YBmoF7F0rNKHuwaRHLdgq">https://open.spotify.com/artist/4YBmoF7F0rNKHuwaRHLdgq</a><br />Soundcloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/leading-edge">https://soundcloud.com/leading-edge</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/LeadingEdge2012/">https://www.facebook.com/pg/LeadingEdge2012/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/leadingedgeofficial/">https://www.instagram.com/leadingedgeofficial/</a><br /> <br />Find Leading Edge's album &quot;Northern Lights&quot; here: <br />to.rexi.es/northern-lights-pre<br /><br />LYRICS (Written by Anna Johannisson): <br /><br />The wind feels warmer now      <br />Uneven ground smoothing out<br />Oh, oooo we will follow   <br />Hunted by morning light   <br />It was cold on that summer night<br />Oh, oooo stars will guide us<br />Hear the birds sing  <br />Of our journey that begins oh, oooo<br />Here on these rolling hills   <br />Past the windmill oh, oooo<br />We’re chasing the northern lights  <br />We’ll make it through before the sun rises  <br />Silence fills my lungs  <br />As dawn catches up on us <br />Gazing at the cliffs above<br />Darkness creeping up on us<br />Oh, oooo vicious creatures<br />Hear them whisper from below<br />Lurking under sticks and stones<br />Oh, oooo reaching for us<br />Hear the birds sing<br />Of our journey that begins oh, oooo<br />Here on these rolling hills <br />Past the windmill oh, oooo<br />We’re chasing the northern lights<br />We’ll make it through before the sun rises<br />Silence fills my lungs<br />As dawn catches up on us<br />We’re chasing the northern lights<br />We’ll make it through before the sun rises<br />Silence fills my lungs<br />As dawn catches up on us<br />We’re chasing the northern lights<br />We’ll make it through before the sun rises<br />Silence fills my lungs<br />As dawn catches up on us{% endraw %}
