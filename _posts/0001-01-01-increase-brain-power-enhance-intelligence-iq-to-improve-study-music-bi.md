{% raw %}In this track we used binaural tone patterns between 12 and 20 Hz (Alpha - Beta range).<br />This range frequency is the most dominant during times of high mental activity. Stimulating beta brainwaves can lead to higher levels of concentration, improving learning ability and attention. To make it effective we recommend listening to it for at least 15 minutes up to the entire duration of the track. You can play it as a background during study or job. For better effectiveness we recommend the use of headphones or earphones at a moderate volume.
