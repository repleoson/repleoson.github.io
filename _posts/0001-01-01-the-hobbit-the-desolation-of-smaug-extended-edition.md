{% raw %}Academy AwardÂ® winner Peter Jackson continues his Middle-Earth saga that follows the adventures of Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) who's swept into an epic quest to reclaim the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor from the fearsome dragon Smaug. In the company of thirteen dwarves and the wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen), Bilbo enters the Lonely Mountain in possession of Gollum's &quot;precious&quot; ring and his keen blade, Sting. With an all-star cast, including many acclaimed actors from The Lord of the Rings (such as Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Elijah Wood, Andy Serkis and more), and the effects wizardry of Jackson's award-winning Weta Workshop, Tolkien's epic story comes to life as never before imagined. The Extended Edition film is 25 minutes longer with new and extended scenes, not seen in the theatrical release.{% endraw %}
