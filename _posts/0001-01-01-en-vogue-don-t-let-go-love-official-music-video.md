This is the home of 90s hits “Hold On,” “My Lovin’ (You’re Never Gonna Get It),” “Giving Him Something He Can Feel,” “Free Your Mind,” and “Don’t Let Go (Love)” among successful albums ‘Born To Sing,’ ‘Funky Divas,’ and ‘EV3,’ and numerous awards and nominations.<br /><br />En Vogue was formed by producers Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy under the vision of a modern R&amp;B girl group with strong vocals, intelligence, and show-stopping glamour. Dawn Robinson, Cindy Herron, Maxine Jones, and Terry Ellis made the cut out of 3,000 women who auditioned. The group was an immediate hit upon their first single in 1990 and set the standard for female vocal groups. Through the evolution of the lineup to the current members of Herron-Braggs, Ellis, and Rhona Bennett, En Vogue continues to tour, release new music, and dazzle and inspire fans everywhere.
