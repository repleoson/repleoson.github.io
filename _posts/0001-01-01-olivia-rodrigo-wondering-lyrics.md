{% raw %}Olivia Rodrigo- Wondering Lyrics<br /><br />&quot;Wondering&quot;<br />(from &quot;High School Musical: The Musical: The Series&quot; soundtrack)<br /><br />Seems like a part of me will always have to lose<br />Every single time I have to choose<br />Swore that it felt right, but was I wrong?<br />Is this where I'm supposed to be at all?<br />I don't have the answers, not today<br />It's like nothing makes the questions go away<br />What I'd give to see if the grass was greener<br /><br />On the other side of all I've had and lost<br />Would it be enough, or would I still be wondering?<br /><br />If I could go back and change the past<br />Be a little braver than I had<br />And bet against the odds<br />Would I still be lost?<br />Even if I woke up in my dreams<br />Would there still be something I'm missing<br />If I had everything, would it mean anything<br />To me?<br /><br />Feels like I might have broke the best thing that I had<br />I said too much to ever take it back<br />Scared I'll never find something as good<br />And would I even know it if I could?<br /><br />From the other side of all I've had and lost<br />Would it be enough, or would I still be wondering?<br />(Or would I still be wondering, oh)<br /><br />If I could go back and change the past<br />Be a little braver than I had<br />And bet against the odds<br />Would I still be lost?<br />Even if I woke up in my dreams<br />Would there still be something I'm missing<br />If I had everything, would it mean anything<br /><br />Maybe I should turn around and take the other road<br />Or maybe I'm just looking for what I already know<br />I'm just wondering<br /><br />If I could go back and change the past<br />Be a little braver than I had<br />And bet against the odds<br />Would I still be lost?<br />Even if I woke up in my dreams<br />Would there still be something I'm missing<br />If I had everything, would it mean anything<br />To me?<br /><br />Would it be enough<br />Or would I still be wondering?<br /><br /><br />Olivia Rodrigo- Wondering Lyrics<br />Olivia Rodrigo- Wondering Lyrics<br />Olivia Rodrigo- Wondering Lyrics<br />Olivia Rodrigo- Wondering Lyrics<br
