I’m a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, and I have worked in various settings of change and growth since 2004. My experience includes juvenile corrections, adventure therapy programs, wilderness therapy programs, an eating disorder treatment center, a residential treatment center, and I currently work in an outpatient therapy clinic.  <br /><br />In therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction. <br />And deeper than all of that, the Gospel of Jesus Christ orients my personal worldview and sense of security, peace, hope, and love <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe">https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe</a><br /><br />If you are in crisis, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/">https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/</a> or 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or your local emergency services.<br />Copyright Therapy in a Nutshell, LLC<br />----<br />Music licensed from www.Bensound.com or Artlist.io<br />Images from Freepik.com (premium license), Pixabay, or Wikimedia commons{% endraw %}
