{% raw %}Hemorrhoids or Piles. This video is on treatment, cream, symptoms, causes and how to get rid of hemorrhoids or piles.<br /><br />Hemorrhoids, also known as piles, are swellings containing enlarged blood vessels found inside or around the bottom (the rectum and anus). In this video were looking at treatment and prevention I hope my tips help.<br /><br />WHAT ARE HEMORRHOIDS:<br />Hemorrhoids, or piles, are abnormal swellings of the vascular mucosal anal cushions around the anus. In many cases, hemorrhoids don't cause symptoms and some people don't even realise they have them.<br /><br />But when symptoms do occur, they may include:<br /><br />• Bleeding after passing a stool – the blood is usually bright red<br />itchy bottom<br />• A lump hanging down outside of the anus, which may need to be pushed back in after passing a stool<br />• A mucus discharge after passing a stool<br />• Soreness, redness and swelling around your anus<br /><br />Hemorrhoids aren't usually painful, unless their blood supply slows down or is interrupted.<br /><br />HEMORRHOID CAUSES:<br />The exact cause of hemorrhoids is unclear, but they're associated with increased pressure in the blood vessels in and around your anus.<br /><br />This pressure can cause the blood vessels in your back passage to become swollen and inflamed.<br /><br />Many cases are thought to be caused by too much straining on the toilet as a result of prolonged constipation. This is often caused by a lack of fibre in a person's diet.<br /><br />Chronic (long-term) diarrhoea can also make you more vulnerable to getting hemorrhoids.<br /><br />Other factors that might increase your risk of developing hemorrhoids include:<br /><br />• Being overweight or obese<br />• Age – as you get older, your body's supporting tissues get weaker, increasing your risk of hemorrhoids<br />• Being pregnant – this can place increased pressure on your pelvic blood vessels, causing them to enlarge<br />• Family history of hemorrhoids<br />• Regularly lifting heavy objects<br />• A persistent cough or repeated vomiting<br />• Sitting down long periods of time<br /><br />PREVENTING AND TREATING HEMRRHOIDS:<br />Hemorrhoid symptoms often settle down after a few days without needing treatment. Hemorrhoids that occur during pregnancy often get better after giving birth.<br /><br />Making lifestyle changes to reduce the strain on the blood vessels in and around your anus is often recommended.<br /><br />These can include:<br />• Gradually increasing the amount of fibre in your diet – good sources of fibre include fruit, vegetables, wholegrain rice, wholewheat pasta and bread, pulses and beans, seeds, nuts and oats<br />• Drinking plenty of fluid – particularly water, but avoiding or cutting down on caffeine and alcohol<br />• Not delaying going to the toilet – ignoring the urge to empty your bowels can make your stools harder and drier, which can lead to straining when you do go to the toilet<br />• Avoiding medication that causes constipation – such as painkillers that contain codeine<br />losing weight if you're overweight.

Generally speaking you want it to contain a local anaesthetic for example lidocaine to help numb the pain in the area in combination with a steroid for example hydrocortisone to help reduce swelling. It’s best to speak to your pharmacist about this so they can make sure it’s safe and suitable for you to use. <br /><br />These treatments should only be used for 5-7 days and are best used after a bowel motion so it stays in the right area for longer.<br /><br />USEFUL LINKS:<br />More information on hemorrhoids and treatments,<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/piles-haemorrhoids/">https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/piles-haemorrhoids/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/piles-haemorrhoids/treatment/">https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/piles-haemorrhoids/treatment/</a><br /><br /><br />Want to see more videos about everything health and pharmacy?
