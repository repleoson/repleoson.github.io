Nobody could have<br />imagined the impact the label would have on pop culture. As a subsidiary of the larger Bad Boy<br />Entertainment, the label became best known for its signature sound of streetwise hip-hop soul and the<br />ghetto fabulousness that radiated like precious jewels from its very name. Bad Boy was designed for<br />those who aspired higher, but also wanted to party until the break of dawn. Puffy had seen life from<br />both sides of the class divide and, with his groove-heavy music, worked hard to merge the two. There is<br />no better visual embodiment of this merger than the groundbreaking videos that were in heavy rotation<br />on BET and MTV and now on YouTube.<br /><br />The Bad Boy Entertainment channel is the official YouTube home of iconic music videos from Puff<br />Daddy, Craig Mack, Faith Evans, 112, Total, Mase, Yung Joc, Cassie, Danity Kane, and the rest of the Bad<br />Boy Family, and your destination for some of the biggest 90s and 00s hip-hop hits of all time like Craig<br />Mack’s “Flava In Your Ear (Remix)”, the Notorious B.I.G. tribute “I’ll Be Missing You” by Puff Daddy feat.<br />Faith Evans and 112, and Cassie – “Me &amp; U”.<br /><br />Subscribe now to join the Bad Boy community, and while you’re here, check out our Bad Boy certified<br />playlists, show us some love in the comments, and stay tuned for updates.
