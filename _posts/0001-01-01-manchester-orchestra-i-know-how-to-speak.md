{% raw %}“This song was originally and roughly formed a few years ago about the impending weight of the future. It almost made it onto Black Mile, but hadn't fully formed yet. We spent some solid time this year revisiting and reworking and recording the song into it's final state. I found it inspiring to work on this song right before the birth of my son, which was and is beautiful impending weight.”  <br />-Andy Hull<br /><br />Stream or Buy the Single Here:<br />Spotify:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://found.ee/MO_IKHTSSpotify">http://found.ee/MO_IKHTSSpotify</a><br />Apple Music:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://found.ee/MO_IKHTSApple">http://found.ee/MO_IKHTSApple</a><br />iTunes:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://found.ee/MO_IKHTSiTunes">http://found.ee/MO_IKHTSiTunes</a><br />Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://found.ee/MO_IKHTSAmazon">http://found.ee/MO_IKHTSAmazon</a><br />Google Play:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://found.ee/MO_IKHTSGooglePlay">http://found.ee/MO_IKHTSGooglePlay</a><br /><br />Follow Manchester Orchestra Here:<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://found.ee/themanchesterorchestra">http://found.ee/themanchesterorchestra</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://found.ee/manchesterorchestra_FB">http://found.ee/manchesterorchestra_FB</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://found.ee/manchesterorchestra_TW">http://found.ee/manchesterorchestra_TW</a><br />Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://found.ee/manchesterorchestra_YT">http://found.ee/manchesterorchestra_YT</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://found.ee/manchesterorchestra_IG">http://found.ee/manchesterorchestra_IG</a><br /><br />LYRICS<br /><br />I know how to speak<br />And I know where I'm going<br />I wanted to seek<br />But I got distracted<br /><br />It's a mirage<br />One that leaves me embarrassed<br />'Cause no one knows me like you<br />You know there's nothing left for you<br />So I continually knew<br />Try to pass it through for you<br />'Cause I bore you<br /><br />Pestered by pain<br />It's time, listen honest<br />So let go of your shame<br />It's a dead, dampening blanket<br /><br />It's a facade<br />I can look at you training<br />There's nobody else like you<br />I think I finally explained it<br />So I continue to move<br />Between the bank and the blanket<br />Don't fake it<br /><br />I, I'm really gonna try this time<br />Gonna give you my heart in spite of my soul<br />I, I'm really gonna to try this time<br />Gonna give you my heart in spite of my soul<br /><br />I want your name<br />Burnt in my ceiling<br />Floats like a flame<br />An unpredictable wonder<br /><br />You gave it all hope<br />And all the of this is a circle<br />There's nobody else like you<br />So many that came before you<br />This is the moment I choose<br />Between the hope and the hardest<br />So be honest<br /><br />I'm really gonna try this time<br />Gonna give you my heart in spite of my soul<br />I'm really gonna try this time<br />Gonna give you my heart in spite of my soul<br /><br />#ManchesterOrchestra #Rock #IndieRock{% endraw %}
