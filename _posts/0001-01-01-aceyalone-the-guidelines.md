{% raw %}The Guidelines<br /><br />A Book of Human Language<br /><br /><br /><br />album came out in 1998<br /><br /><br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br /><br /><br />Let's begin<br /><br />Asalaam alaikum, people of good will<br /><br />I offer you the greeting of thought manifested skill<br /><br />to finally reveal the open-end chapter<br /><br />As real as the flesh that you're embodied in<br /><br />to the skull cavity your mind is rotting in, I'll be riding in<br /><br />And there might have been a slight, rotation warp to curve<br /><br />the course of course I'm cordial when I'm reportin<br /><br />I won't distort, I don't contort<br /><br />connect conduct collect console or conceal<br /><br />In full control of the roll of the wheel<br /><br />My eyes are my appliance to decipher the science<br /><br />Omitting defiance with the high-tech mic check<br /><br />The buttons that flashed I pushed for absolute<br /><br />destruction your structure is lifted from the ground<br /><br />The foundation mound is broke, so you float around<br /><br />I'm embedded in what is known as beat<br /><br />Let it be shown, every enzyme is complete<br /><br />In time, you'll see the pace of the pulse pump<br /><br />rapidly, heart rate, happily marched<br /><br />I happen to be the dark man who holds the charts<br /><br />I arch my horizontal line to make a rainbow<br /><br />.. but it ain't the same though, yo<br /><br />The tried and true pros are chasing fool's gold<br /><br />sliding through holes, like small rodents<br /><br />It's obviously, evident my embellishment<br /><br />peaks at two-ninety-two I.Q.<br /><br />Cause Big Ace is the spinner, in the, center<br /><br />Inventor, and I plan to be a winner meaning<br /><br />I'll be in inner outer ovaries, overload, overboard<br /><br />overseas hearin oversees more, than the eye can<br /><br />I stand, limited primative, sentimentalist, escapist<br /><br />The way I shape this landscape, automatically makes this, vivid<br /><br />I give it a rivet, hold it, stand at the pivot<br /><br />I love it, learn to live it, then give you my exhibit<br /><br />Not inhibited, not even a little bit, when I'm inclined<br /><br />My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines<br /><br />and you can play the sidelines, ride rhymes in your spare time<br /><br />My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guideline<br /><br />You can play the sideline, ride rhymes in your spare time<br /><br />cause I'd rather stimulate your mind than emulate your purpose<br /><br />And we have only touched on the surface of the serpent<br /><br />Consider me part of the dust, in the dusk<br /><br />I must collect the samples from the rust<br /><br />Penetrate the crust then trust no living<br /><br />Driven by the sonic, language passion<br /><br />Your ashes spark the flashes, of the neon<br /><br />from be-yond, what kind of planet could I be on?<br /><br />I don't know, but I'ma be on, for eons, and eons<br /><br />While many think that they can never play out<br /><br />Get trapped in a timeframe, and never find their way out<br /><br />I stay off the dramatization, and I balance<br /><br />Always seeking the challenge, to show the world<br /><br />the incredible talents, I cut the corners, smooth out the surfaces<br /><br />Worthlessness is just, half of the problem<br /><br />I read the greek kid, I did every column<br /><br />I note the animal kingdom, and the phylum<br /><br />WHYLUM style em, until they get to hit the target<br /><br />I mark it on the bullseye, of flies<br /><br />and the buffalo wing in the sky<br /><br />My architectnique sparks the dark streets of your resting ground<br /><br />I suggest that you warn your town<br /><br />I inhabit the oxygen, mark off the memory<br /><br />You will never forget to remember the lone wolverine<br /><br />marine biologist machine with the verbal<br /><br />Internal mind fertile, foot, over hurdle<br /><br />Tight, like Godel, and my word'll be the last<br /><br />I incubate, every other millineuim<br /><br />I fast and I hibernate, to pass any of em<br /><br />I am potent, untraceable<br /><br />No color no odor no taste no replaceable parts<br /><br />No heart, no head just a carcas<br /><br />The darkest days come, right before the light<br /><br />I watch my watch and stand right before the mic<br /><br />By the powers, vested in me, I digested MC's<br /><br />food for thought, caught on to the end of the rope and swung<br /><br />Then stood stiff, as if, I was on a cliff<br /><br />Not beneath sticks, my feet are made of bricks<br /><br />When I walk my footprints end in cement<br /><br />I am not practical, nor am I unusual<br /><br />Nor am I oblivious to, hideous crimes<br /><br />Every city is captured and trapped in my mind<br /><br />Given the spinal tap, as the final rap climbs<br /><br />My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines<br /><br />You can play the sidelines, ride rhymes in your spare time<br /><br />My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines<br /><br />You can play the sidelines, ride rhymes in your spare time<br /><br />Cause I have become the night owl on the prowl<br /><br />Master of the freebin pile style<br /><br />Cause I'm, om-nipotent<br /><br />I'm, some, government experiment that is out of control<br /><br />I'm from some big black hole<br /><br />I square up, select, and rec'd, every tangle<br /><br />I flare up, and you can try, any angle<br /><br />Even Bermuda, but I bury the barracuda<br /><br />then I'm, octa-gone in the wind with the pollen{% endraw %}
