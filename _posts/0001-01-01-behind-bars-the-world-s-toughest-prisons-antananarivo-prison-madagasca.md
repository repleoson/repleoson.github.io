{% raw %}Behind Bars - Episode 3: Antananarivo Prison, Madagascar | Prison Documentary<br /><br />The World's Toughest Prisons will reveal what it really means to be part of this very special world - from different angles. At each prison we visit, the audience will be immersed into daily prison life. The viewer will experience firsthand the challenges each guard faces on a daily basis; likewise, he will learn about the prisoner's struggles to develop strategies for survival.<br /><br />But the deep insights in this series will also allow the audience to experience the other side of the story: why was the prison built like this? What kind of rules and security measures exist here? And how are the prisoners monitored and, if they break the rules, punished?<br /><br />This documentation is a never-before-seen insight into an unbelievable world, which exists within the realms of law and justice but with its own definitions of right and wrong.<br />This is a story audiences will love to experience, while simultaneously being thankful that it isn’t their own.<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Subscribe Free Documentary Channel for free: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2YJ4XzQ">https://bit.ly/2YJ4XzQ</a><br />Join the club and become a Free Documentary Patron: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/freedocumentary">https://www.patreon.com/freedocumentary</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG">https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI">https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI</a><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />#FreeDocumentary #Documentary #BehindBars<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br /><br />Free Documentary is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on YouTube for free.
