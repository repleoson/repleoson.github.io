When they both turned 18 they went to the shrine to get their sign. The goddess Aeveries sign is a bond that you and your soulmate will have, each sign is different. If you have feelings for someone besides your soulmate you and your partner will feel intense pain, forcing you two to separate. After Kace and Heather receive their sign, they realised they weren't destined to be. Heather wanted the best for Kace so she let him go even though she didn't want too. Kace didn't want to face reality and tried his best to avoid his fate. Lena and Kace meet and find they are meant to be. Lena tries to be strong and patient with Kace knowing they are meant to be even though Kace is stubborn. Heather wants to find her soulmate and pays for a procedure, but finds out that she doesn't have one...After more problems arise Kace was able to personally meet Goddess Aeverie and begs her to change the signs. Goddess Aeverie reveals that Heather is not meant to be on earth and she made a big mistake. She plans to erase Heather from the earth so everyone's destinies will go back in line. Having Heather on earth was going to destroy not only Kaces future but others. Kace didn't want to forget Heather and wanted to stay with Heather,  he tried his best with 2 hours of time to keep Heather alive. He finally realised that nothing would work and Heather realised that she wasn't meant to be on earth in the first place. Everything went back to normal and Heather turns into a goddess. In the end, you see Heather still connected to a human she doesnt &quot;know&quot; and Kace who forgot her existence and married Lena. <br /><br />Music: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/XCr0bsng60Y">https://youtu.be/XCr0bsng60Y</a><br /><br />Inspirational Piano by Draganov89 |  <br />Promoted by Music Fellows |  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/MF_official">http://bit.ly/MF_official</a><br />Video Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/X11EC849J78">https://youtu.be/X11EC849J78</a><br />CC BY 4.0 | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/m4docFmsvhE">https://youtu.be/m4docFmsvhE</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ID4CiVVxSG0">https://youtu.be/ID4CiVVxSG0</a><br /><br />Song : Demised To Shield<br />Download Link ( <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/8m7a3t...">https://www.mediafire.com/file/8m7a3t...</a> )<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/IagG8vCnMvc">https://youtu.be/IagG8vCnMvc</a><br /><br />**There are other music tracks I used but I can't find them, sorry!!**<br /><br />!!DM'S ARE CLOSED!!<br />I'm very busy nowadays, super sorry! ðŸ’›<br /><br />(Used some quotes like per usual)<br /><br />!!
