{% raw %}Fact is definitely stranger than fiction! This book is about overcoming the ultimate challenges of an extreme and unexpected 'lockdown'! Imagine in the midst of a contract dispute in a civil court case, unexpectedly being held 'in contempt of court' (in a civil court) and with no police or criminal court  involvement and criminal charges ever brought, you find yourself being sent to one of the only civil prisoners in history to serve time in Pentonville prison, one of the toughest prisons in the UK. <br />I met the author Peter Sage in the early 2000s working at a Tony Robbins event where Peter was at the time the youngest ever Tony Robbins trainer. Like myself Peter has dedicated his life to both personal and business growth, the last person you would imagine serving time in prison. Early on Peter viewed these events as an adventure and an opportunity to serve others and to grow and boy did he deliver!{% endraw %}
