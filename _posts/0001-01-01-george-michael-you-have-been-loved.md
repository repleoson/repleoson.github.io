{% raw %}George Michael - You Have Been Loved<br />Movie scenes - Meet Joe Black<br />Songwriters - David Austin<br />Album - Older [1996]<br />Label - Virgin Records<br />___The album was dedicated to Antonio Carlos Jobim, who changed the way IGeorge listened to music, and to Anselmo Feleppa. <br /><br />&quot;She takes the back road and the lane<br />Past the school that has no changed<br />In all this time<br />She thinks of when the boy was young<br />All the battles she had won<br />Just to give him life<br />That man<br />She loved that man<br />For all his life<br />But now we meet to bring him flowers<br />And only God knows why<br />For what's the use in pressing pamls<br />When children fade in mother's arms<br />It's a cruel world<br />We've so much to loose<br />And what we have to learn we rarely choose<br />So if it's God who took her son<br />He cannot be the one living in her mind<br />Take care my love, she said<br />Don't think that God is dead<br />Take care my love, she said<br />You have been loved<br />If I was weak, forgive me<br />But I was terrified<br />You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love<br />The kind that makes devils cry<br />So these days<br />My life has changed<br />And I'll be fine<br />But she just sits and counts the hours<br />Searching for her crime<br />So what's the use of pressing palms<br />If you won't keep such love from harm<br />It's a cruel world<br />You've so much to prove<br />And heaven helps the ones who wait for you<br />Well I've no daughters, I've no sons<br />Guess I'm the only one<br />Living in my life<br />Take care my love, he said<br />Don't think that God is dead<br />Take care my love, he said<br />You have been loved..&quot;<br /><br /><br />_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />This upload have the purpose of promoting a fine piece of music.
