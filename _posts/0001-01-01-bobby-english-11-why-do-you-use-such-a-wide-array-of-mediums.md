{% raw %}About the artist: &quot;There are other worlds within it that we have never, and may never experience. Worlds can be many shapes, sizes, and colors. Worlds are my catalyst, my inspiration, and my bridge from mind to surface. Through various mediums, I attempt to interpret the worlds I dream, the worlds I believe exist, the worlds I think I have only experienced in my head.&quot; -- Bobby English<br /><br />Artist's images featured in the Annual Report  www.mica.edu/x20964.xml{% endraw %}
