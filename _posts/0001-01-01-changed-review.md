{% raw %}6/20/18 God damn its been only 3 days and this video already has more views than I ever anticipated, I expected under 100 views max, thanks a ton guys.<br /><br />0:45 the developer, DragonSnow, is CHINESE, not japanese, my bad, I assumed there were no furries in China, much like how nothing happened in Tiananmen Square on June 4th, 1989.<br /><br />7:51 ARTIST: TOOT<br /><br />Footage is recorded by me unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Music is from Changed unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />I mostly wrote this as a way to practice articulating my thoughts and opinions and express them, as opposed to lying awake at night and listening to them ricochet around my head, trapped and contributing to my lack of sleep and deterioration of my sanity. I don't even care if people ever see this, I just want to be satisfied that on a sleepless night, a fellow bozo will stumble across this trash heap and in a spell of terror realize that for atleast one unsettling, transient moment, I existed and was compelled to talk about stupid shit.<br /><br />This was my first review and it definitely shows, but it was still a lot of fun making this.<br /><br />It took about 2 days of nonstop working from start to finish to make this (mostly because of my lack of experience in a ***COMPLETELY LEGAL*** copy of sony vegas). I was utterly compelled to create this video for some odd reason, and literally did nothing but sit and work on this shit for those 2 days.<br /><br />I also had to redo some sections because the rendering aspect ratio didn't match up with the project aspect ratio., the intro gachi scene was the most time consuming to redo. <br /><br />I didn't expect to be this passionate about a weird furry game, but weird shit happens in life and you never really know what to expect.<br /><br />I never asked any of these people for permission to use their footage, it was last moment because a lot of my footage was missing audio. I atleast gave credit where it was due. If you don't want me to use your footage then I will remove it, but I reserve the right to call you a cunt.<br /><br />Censoring a lot of this shit took forever, hopefully the evil puritans who run this site overlook this video.<br /><br />After sleeping on it for a while I have come to the conclusion that I was compelled to create this video to express how I felt while playing the game. I was at first bothered by it, but later grew to enjoy it. This video is me expressing that I enjoyed the game and my rapid descent into unbridled degeneracy and that you can blow me if you don't like it.{% endraw %}
