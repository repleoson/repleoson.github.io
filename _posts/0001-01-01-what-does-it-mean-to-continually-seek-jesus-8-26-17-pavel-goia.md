{% raw %}We need to put our eyes on Jesus. We need to spend time with Jesus. That is how we get to know Him and trust Him. Courtship and marriage give us an illustration of how God wants to to be with us, talk with us, share with us. We need to seek Jesus not  His blessings.<br />Trust means that we believe that God knows what we need and we don't have to ask for our needs. We need God's personal presence in us. Stop spending time on things that don't save.  Make God's presence a priority! Seek God. Faith is when you make a decision to trust without seeing.  We can't afford to take our eyes off Jesus.  That is how sin is overcome. That is how we receive the fruit of the Spirit. When we have Jesus we have everything needful.{% endraw %}
