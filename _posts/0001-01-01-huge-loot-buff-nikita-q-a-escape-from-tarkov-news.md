{% raw %}Correction: In-Raid Trader coming to LIGHTHOUSE NOT SHORELINE I misspoke my bad. 5:25<br />Yesterday Nikita Buyanov, the lead dev of Escape from Tarkov was on a Russian gaming podcast where they asked a lot of questions and got a lot of answers. Then today we got a HUGE buff to the spawn chances of pretty much every rare, or expensive item in Escape from Tarkov.<br />Nikita's &quot;Roadmap&quot; Post Vid: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/CVocFeO7Qq4">https://youtu.be/CVocFeO7Qq4</a><br />Today's Changes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://imgur.com/a/EZxx1qU">https://imgur.com/a/EZxx1qU</a><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Become a FORNICATING Member: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3eQQmMw">https://bit.ly/3eQQmMw</a><br />JOIN THE DISCORD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.com/invite/noiceguys">https://discord.com/invite/noiceguys</a><br />Second Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3077dnz">https://bit.ly/3077dnz</a><br />LATEST Tarkov News: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/39XY1Yo">http://bit.ly/39XY1Yo</a><br />EFT Like a PRO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2YVPEGs">http://bit.ly/2YVPEGs</a><br />Support the Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/noiceguy">https://ko-fi.com/noiceguy</a><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Although I do sometimes get a hand from BSG and occasionally get to talk to Nikita or other members of the team, I do not work for BSG. I also work entirely off public information and past experiences of working in game dev myself, as well as following this game closely for several years. Unless I state very clearly otherwise, the information you're about to hear should be taken as speculation. You can either get no information or speculation, that's all we have to go off of these days unfortunately which is why it's easier to just say Thursday whenever anyone asks for dates. If you want hard facts and dates you won't get them, period.{% endraw %}
