{% raw %}The technique of making sandals from used motorcycle tires.<br />Used motorcycle tires that can be used to make sandals are large and wide motorcycle tires.<br />In this video I will make sandals from used motorcycle tires, but use a bisban to make it more attractive.<br />The learning steps are:<br />1. Cut a wide used motorcycle tire, cut according to the pattern<br />2. Make a sandal sling with a bisban<br />3. Make a hole in the face of the sandal, make a side incision where the sash is.<br />4. Attach the sash<br />For more details, my friend, watch the video until it runs out ...<br />Hopefully this is useful and thank you for watching our video.<br /><br />#makesandals#usedtires#DIY#{% endraw %}
