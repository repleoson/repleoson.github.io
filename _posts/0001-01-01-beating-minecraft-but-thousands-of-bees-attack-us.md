{% raw %}Beating Minecraft, But Thousands Of Bees Attack Us... This was a crazy challenge!<br /><br />Follow my socials:<br />➽ Twitter - @dream<br />➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken<br />➽ Snapchat - @dreampublic<br /><br />Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dream.shop">https://www.dream.shop</a><br /><br />George: @GeorgeNotFound <br /><br />Patreon (Plugins): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/DreamWasTaken">https://www.patreon.com/DreamWasTaken</a><br /><br />This is our first Minecraft challenge done in Minecraft update 1.15, so we decided to do it with the bees. Every minute the number of bees rises... The server is laggy and we have a  lot of trouble, but we try and beat the game.<br /><br />Title similar to Minecraft, But Item Drops Are Multiplied Every Time...{% endraw %}
