The book is an  intimate look into the rapport between 2 great minds of our times - Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman both psychologists - who changed how we think about how we think. I believe it's is an important read for novices and beginners in social sciences, medicine, law, business, philosophy and public policy. The Author of the book is Michael Lewis best known for his Moneyball  and The Big Short - both of which are now movies. He has an undergraduate degree in art history and a Master's in economics and I loved his easy-to-read writing style. <br /><br />Read time : 20 hours approximately (since I took notes and cross-references a lot) <br />Star Rating : 7 out of 5 stars <br />Book publication Date : 2016 (English)<br /><br /><br />‚óÜ a b o u t  m e<br />Hi, I‚Äôm Radhika Bapat and I have an MA, Mphil and PhD In Clinical Psychology. I am a columnist at Hufftington Post‚Äôs @Thrive Global, YourStory and Times of India. Since the mental health fallout of the pandemic, I have been creating free content to help people outside the space of individual therapy. I served as Head of the Department of Behavioural Sciences and Mental Health at Sahyadri Hospitals in Pune from 2009-2018 and resigned from this post to pursue my passions - reading, playing and seeing clients in my own ‚Äúgreen‚Äù private set-up, which I find to be most holistically healing. I am married to Fulbright-Hays fellow and scholar in South Asian studies Dr. Justin Scarimbolo. Together we have a son, Neel, with whom we travel between our two homes in Pune, India and the Catskills Mountains of upstate New York. ‚Ä™ ‚Ä¨‚Ä¨<br /><br />‚óÜ s o c i a l  m e d i a  l i n k s <br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/4ambookclub">https://www.facebook.com/groups/4ambookclub</a><br />INSTAGRAM : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/psychotherapybar/">https://www.instagram.com/psychotherapybar/</a><br />TWITTER : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/4amBookclub">https://twitter.com/4amBookclub</a> <br /><br />‚óÜ t o o l s  &amp;  e q u i p m e n t<br />Just my phone and my computer.
