You can see their eyes light up and their interest is visibly raised when presented with these strong images. Add to that the extra dimensions of movement and sound, and your baby will be suitably impressed!<br /><br />Most is available from the YouTube Audio Library!...<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/...">https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/...</a><br /><br />Music Track List<br /><br />Chimez - Dan Henig<br />Pluck It Up - Dan Henig<br />Enuff Para Mi - Jingle Punks<br />Merengue de Limon - Quincas Moreira<br />Mr. Pink - Topher Mohr and Alex Elena<br />Funk Down - MK2<br />Fun - Vibe Tracks<br />Coconut Lime Riddim - Konrad OldMoney<br />Cumbia No Frills Faster - Kevin MacLeod<br /><br />Cumbia No Frills Faster by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution licence (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100275">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100275</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a><br /><br />Category<br />Entertainment{% endraw %}
