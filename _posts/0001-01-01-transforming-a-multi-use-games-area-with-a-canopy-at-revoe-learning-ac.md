{% raw %}A multi use games area from Streetspace has helped Revoe Learning Academy encourage outdoor activities from a young age, all year round.<br /><br />This highly effective covered MUGA has proved to be extremely popular with both pupils and the local community. It’s a very attractive part of the school grounds and has already begun to drive change around the local area. Pupils can make full use of the all-weather sports pitch and its canopy for a whole host of games – including rugby, football, cheerleading, cricket, netball, and hockey.<br />The cover and flexibility of the area also means it’s used by the school and its students for drama performances, outdoor learning, and assemblies. The community also has access for evening and weekend events, including sports, activities and one-off events like summer fairs &amp; Christmas markets.<br />Check out our full project case study here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://streetspacegroup.co.uk/case_study/revoe-learning-academy/">https://streetspacegroup.co.uk/case_study/revoe-learning-academy/</a><br /><br />Speak to our Streetspace advisors today!
