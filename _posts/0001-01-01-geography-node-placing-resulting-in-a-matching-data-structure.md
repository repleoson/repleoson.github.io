{% raw %}(Sorry for the sound, had to film my screen because my recording software didn't like WebGL).<br /><br />50 nodes(invisible) placed on a 1d space (a circle). Issuing transactions as a Directed Acyclic Graph where 1 transaction always references 2 others. Transactions are issued at random between the nodes. If a node sees a transaction it will gossip this to neighbours until a transaction travelled a max distance.<br /><br />The white dots show the data-structure 'vision' of a single network node.<br /><br />The transactions are placed together by a force-directed placing method.<br /><br />The end result is a data-structure that forms to the physical topology of the network topology.<br />Creating physical location properties within digital data structures.{% endraw %}
