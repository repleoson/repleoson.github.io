{% raw %}Filmed on the last day Saturday 20th July 2013<br /><br />From the Manchester International Festival Brochure: <br /><br />This radical &amp; immersive work plunges visitors into a pulsating sensory landscape, by turns enigmatic and recognisable. Taking advantage of the visitor's own dilating pupils, This Variation constantly shifts perception, processing and transforming before eye and ear. <br /><br />Tino Sehgal is one of contemporary art's true pioneers, expanding the exhibition format into sensual and personal realms. His work featured in MIF11's 11 Rooms and MIF07's Il Tempo del Postino.<br /><br />CREDIT<br />Programmed by Hans Ulrich Obrist, Alex Poots, Asad Raza and Tino Sehgal.<br />Commissioned by (d)ocumenta13 and Manchester International Festival.{% endraw %}
