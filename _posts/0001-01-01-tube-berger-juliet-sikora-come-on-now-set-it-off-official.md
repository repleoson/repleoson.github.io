Inspired by Strafe's 1984 electro funk classic on the same name and spanning everything from retro-synths to techy elements the track is a true illustration of their wide musical compass, with an organic sounding guitar reflecting their early roots in punk music. Never ones to rest on their laurels, this cut is a further string to their evermore impressive bow, coming as it does at the tail end of Tuber &amp; Berger's most triumphant year to date with a momentum they will unquestionably carry on into the next.{% endraw %}
