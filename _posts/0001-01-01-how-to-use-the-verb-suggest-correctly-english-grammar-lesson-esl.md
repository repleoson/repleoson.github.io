{% raw %}How to use thew verb 'Suggest' correctly? English Grammar Lesson ( ESL) <br /><br />It's a common problem that with English learners: a lot of people use the word  &quot;suggest&quot; incorrectly. In this video lesson Niharika explains how you should use it.<br /><br />The thing to remember is that you suggest an idea, not the person that you're making your suggestion to. In other words, this is incorrect:<br /><br />I suggest you to apply for a job there. ( wrong)<br /><br />Instead, say one of these:<br />I suggest applying for a job there.<br />I suggest that you apply for a job there.<br /><br />You may also hear sentences that are similar to the last one, but  without &quot;that&quot;:<br />I suggest you apply for a job there.<br /><br />In this sentence, it may seem like you're suggesting a person  instead of an idea. But if you examine it more closely, you're  suggesting the complete idea that &quot;you apply for a job there&quot;:<br /><br />I suggest (you apply for a job there).<br />One other thing to remember: don't use &quot;to&quot; after suggest: I suggest to apply for a job there.<br /><br />Here are some other examples which use &quot;suggest&quot; correctly:<br /><br />I would suggest waiting a few more weeks.<br />He suggested I give you a call.<br />Didn't you suggest bringing in a consulting firm?<br />So do you suggest that we go forward with the surgery?<br />Now that you know how to use &quot;suggest&quot;, here's a bonus tip: the  word &quot;recommend&quot; works exactly the same way!{% endraw %}
