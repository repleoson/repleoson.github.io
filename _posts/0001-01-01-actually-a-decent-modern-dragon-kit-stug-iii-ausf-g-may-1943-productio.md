{% raw %}Today we will look at Dragon 6578 -- StuG III Ausf.G May 1943 Production mit Schurzen.  This kit builds up an excellent Kursk-era Sturmgeschutz.  In this video I will point out any issues I encountered with the instructions, fitment of the parts, level of detail, and also historical accuracy of the vehicle.  <br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Follow me on Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/panzermeister36/">https://www.instagram.com/panzermeister36/</a><br /><br />My Facebook Page: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/340301663065416/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel">https://www.facebook.com/groups/340301663065416/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel</a><br /><br />Support me and my videos on Patreon!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Panzermeister36">https://www.patreon.com/Panzermeister36</a><br /><br />The tank-themed cutting mat is by Tankraft:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tankraft.com/">https://tankraft.com/</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I am not paid to promote any specific products or brands; I just use the products I find work best for me through my experiences.  There is no reason for me to promote a bad product, as then I would not enjoy using it, not like the result on my model, and not be proud of publicizing it in a video.  There's also no point in me doing this to keep up relations with a company if the only benefit would be getting more of the same products that I didn't like.  I have not used every product out there, but from what I have used, I keep using the products I like, and that's why I use them in my videos.  You can use whatever other products you would like to and you can feel that they are better - that is your opinion, and is perfectly fine by me, thus I hope that feeling is reciprocated.{% endraw %}
