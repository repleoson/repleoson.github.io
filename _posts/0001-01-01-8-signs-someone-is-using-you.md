{% raw %}Have you ever had a sneaking suspicion that someone might be trying to get the upper hand? Do you only hear from that one friend of yours only when they need something? Feeling used by someone else can be seen in all aspects of our lives, and it can harm your self-esteem and mental health. Maybe it’s a friend in your life that you only hear from when they need something. Or a supervisor that pushes you to stay that extra hour. Perhaps it’s even a controlling partner that insists you buy them that new makeup kit they’ve been eyeing. Have you ever had a sneaking suspicion that someone might be trying to exploit and manipulate you or get the upper hand? If so, we've made this video for you to help you identify the signs someone is using you. <br /><br />Reminder: While we here at Psych2Go understand that it’s hurtful, we just want to remind you Psych2Goers of your worth! It’s important to remember that we’re not responsible for the actions of others, but we are in full control of how we react to them. But if you still feel hard to forgive yourself or are too hard on yourself about this, we've previously made a video on the signs you may be too hard on yourself: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/seHB34meY-M">https://youtu.be/seHB34meY-M</a><br /><br />Domestic Abuse and Violence Resources:<br />National Domestic Hotline<br />www.thehotline.org/<br />U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services<br />www.tinyurl.com/y5fwvzjo<br /><br />Writer: Michael Ritchie <br />Script Editor: Rida Batool <br />Script Manager: Kelly Soong <br />VO: Amanda Silvera <br />Animator: Naphia <br />(www.youtube.com/channel/UCFZpFR9GzTx_YqVDVYrb_DA)<br />YouTube Manager: Cindy Cheong <br /><br />“Are You Being Used in Your Relationship?
