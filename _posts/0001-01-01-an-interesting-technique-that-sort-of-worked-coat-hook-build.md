{% raw %}In this video I uses an interesting technique and try and uses it in a project. I try to make a coat hoot using a punch and split idea. It sort of works but the idea is sound. I will go over the process on how to do the technique and what you will need to do it and then show you how to uses it in a project. In honesty I could have done a better jobs of the hooks.
