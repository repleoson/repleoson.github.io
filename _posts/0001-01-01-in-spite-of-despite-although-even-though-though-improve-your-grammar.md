{% raw %}in spite of | despite | although | even though | though | English Grammar <br /><br />Hi Everyone! <br /><br />Let's boost your grammar and vocabulary with these important English words. In spite of, despite, although, even though and though, all show CONTRAST. <br /><br />We use them to talk about things that happen when something else doesn't matter. <br /><br />These words can be used in any situation! If you are taking an exam (TOEFL, IELTS, Cambridge etc.) try to add these to your writing and speaking tasks. Show the examiner that you can form strong sentences! <br /><br />If you SUBSCRIBE to my channel and turn on those NOTIFICATIONS, you'll never miss a lesson. <br /><br />Would you like to SUPPORT my channel?  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/arnel">https://ko-fi.com/arnel</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/arnelseverydayenglish/">https://www.instagram.com/arnelseverydayenglish/</a> <br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ArnelsEverydayEnglish/">https://www.facebook.com/ArnelsEverydayEnglish/</a> <br /><br />I hope this lesson is helpful!
