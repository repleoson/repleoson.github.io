{% raw %}Learn the difference between &quot;much&quot; and &quot;many&quot; with this English grammar lesson.<br /><br />We use many when asking about quantity with countable nouns with the expression &quot;how many&quot;. Example: How many apples are there?<br /><br />We use how much for asking about quantity with uncountable nouns. Example: How much milk is there?<br /><br />We also use many in negative sentences with countable nouns to describe a small quantity or amount. Example: &quot;There aren't many apples.&quot;<br /><br />For describing a small quantity with uncountable nouns, then we use much in the negative, for example &quot;there isn't much wine.&quot;<br /><br />For positive sentences to express a large quantity, we do NOT use much or many. We prefer &quot;a lot of&quot; or &quot;lots of&quot;. For example &quot;There are a lot of oranges&quot; and &quot;there is a lot of milk.<br /><br />At the end of the English lesson, there are some grammar exercises to test your understanding.<br /><br />The accent is a British English accent and there are subtitles / closed captions during the whole video lesson.<br /><br /><br />For more information about the differences between countable and uncountable nouns, see this lesson: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFUztCn_ldU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFUztCn_ldU</a><br /><br />More grammar lessons: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6BDo90oiwpS4_AM1c0s0ozpROeE2A9ff">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6BDo90oiwpS4_AM1c0s0ozpROeE2A9ff</a><br /><br /><br />Listening exercises: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6BDo90oiwpRdmnAzmYwdc0Az0ZOG2XNA">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6BDo90oiwpRdmnAzmYwdc0Az0ZOG2XNA</a><br /><br /><br />Vocabulary videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6BDo90oiwpTlYAYSitjwWn29BEdCBi9j">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6BDo90oiwpTlYAYSitjwWn29BEdCBi9j</a><br /><br />Private English lessons &amp; speaking practice: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/0Uuo47">http://goo.gl/0Uuo47</a><br /><br />Andrew,<br />Crown Academy of English<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.crownacademyenglish.com">http://www.crownacademyenglish.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/CrownAcademyEnglish">http://www.youtube.com/user/CrownAcademyEnglish</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Crown_English">https://twitter.com/Crown_English</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Photo credits:<br /><br /><br />&quot;Pretty Schoolgirl Pointing Towards Copy Space Area&quot; Image courtesy of stockimages | FreeDigitalPhotos.net{% endraw %}
