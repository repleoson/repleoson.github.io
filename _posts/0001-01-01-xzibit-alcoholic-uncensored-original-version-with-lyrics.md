Oklahoma<br />Watch the aroma, catch those who love me<br />My underground dirty cats on dune buggies<br />I be the type to take your watch and flaunt it<br />Kidnap T. Lewis and Jimmy Jam on it<br />Yo, I bang a nigga head til his neck pop<br />Do a KR's one to a black cop<br />X and E's, out for cream, get the money<br />While you stay broker than Al Bundy<br />Uhh, give it to yall, in Any Given Sunday<br />With J. Fox namin tha spot, make it hot<br />(I hate E so much right now!) Blow it down nigga, bounce<br />come off the ropes like J. Snooka<br />(Two fly motherfuckers) You can't fuck widdit<br />Backed by Open Bar, so y'all forget it<br /><br />[Chorus]<br /><br />[J-Ro]<br />J McEnroe, cam smashin, party crashin<br />I eat MC's like a ration<br />I'm sockin niggaz in their goatees<br />I leave you stiffer than that fool on my basketball trophies<br />I'm in the room with 10 G's, countin ten G's<br />Cause we need a bag of weed (can you smell it?)<br />Now we need ten dimes, to blow on these like wind chimes<br />Time to close the blinds cause you all in mines<br />I bought a bottle for the session, and did not share it<br />Drink so much Captain Mo' all I need is a parrot<br />You took the Alkaholik challenge, and lost your balance<br />You underground, we under water drinkin liquid by tha gallons<br /><br />[Tash]<br />Slurred words, double vision, brain bustin, head rushin<br />Since I'm too drunk to walk, I rock a party on crutches<br />and still rush the roughest MC who wanna get it<br />Forget it, it's liquid, don't mix it, Xzibit<br />Ca-Tash on the blast the final piece to the puzzle<br />I slap bitches on the ass, I slap pimps about the muzzle<br />I shuffle with the microphone, bang rhymes consistant<br />You wack and I'm Ca-Tash and that's the motherfuckin difference<br />For instance, 21 and over, set your clocks back<br />(Tick tock tick tock) Still standin where the rocks at<br />Two-thousand-one, we still young guns that's restless<br />(Thirty niggaz, sixty hoes) and that's the motherfuckin guestlist<br /><br />[Chorus]{% endraw %}
