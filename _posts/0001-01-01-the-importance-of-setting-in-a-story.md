{% raw %}Setting is one of the five essential elements of a story. It establishes the mood, reveals characters and conflicts, and gives clues to a story's theme. In this video, we’ll see how time and place can do more than just give context. Students will learn to pay attention to “the where” and “the when” as they read and make inferences about a text.<br /><br />Check out all the educational videos from Flocabulary, often called the &quot;Schoolhouse Rock&quot; of the 21st Century, at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://flocabulary.com">http://flocabulary.com</a> <br /><br />For lesson plans and activities that go along with this video, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.flocabulary.com/unit/setting/">https://www.flocabulary.com/unit/setting/</a><br /><br />Connect With Us!<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/flocabulary">http://www.twitter.com/flocabulary</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/flocabulary">http://www.facebook.com/flocabulary</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/flocabulary">http://www.instagram.com/flocabulary</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pinterest.com/flocabulary">http://www.pinterest.com/flocabulary</a><br /><br />Beat by Chemist{% endraw %}
