{% raw %}Examines the spread of ideas along the Erie Canal, with an emphasis on women’s rights, suffrage, and the quest for social justice. The film threads together movements to end slavery and secure women’s right to vote. Themes include: the influence of the Haudenosaunee on suffragists like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Matilda Joslyn Gage; the women left out of the suffrage narrative who faced voting barriers despite the passage of the 19th Amendment; and expanding opportunities for women today. The documentary was produced by WCNY for the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor with funding support from the National Park Foundation, the National Park Service, and the New York State Canal Corporation.<br /><br />For more information: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.wcny.org/eriecanal/">http://www.wcny.org/eriecanal/</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/WCNYCONNECTED">https://twitter.com/WCNYCONNECTED</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/WCNYCONNECTED/">https://www.facebook.com/WCNYCONNECTED/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/wcnyconnected/">https://www.instagram.com/wcnyconnected/</a>{% endraw %}
