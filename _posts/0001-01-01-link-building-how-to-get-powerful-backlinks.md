{% raw %}Learn exactly how to build links from authority sites.<br /><br />In fact, I’ve used the link building strategies in this video to get backlinks from authority sites like Forbes, Inc, TechCrunch and more.<br /><br />With that, here are the 9 strategies I’m going to cover in today’s video.<br /><br />First up, we have link roundups. This is one of my favorite ways to get links from blogs in ANY industry (even “boring” ones).<br /><br />The second strategy I’ll cover is broken link building. I’ve been using this SEO strategy more and more this year and it’s working super well. I also walk you through the entire process.<br /><br />Next up, we have a link building technique that’s like guest posting… but way better.<br /><br />Our fourth technique is to create branded strategies and methods. This is more of a content marketing tip than an SEO strategy. But as you’ll see, it also happens to be a great way to get backlinks and higher Google rankings.<br /><br />The next strategy is to get mentions (and links) from news sites and blogs. How? Become a source for their stories and articles.<br /><br />The 6th strategy in the video is something called: “Pre Outreach”. I explain how it works with a real life case study.<br /><br />Next, I show you how to get backlinks from .edu sites. <br /><br />And for link building strategy #8, we’ve got The Moving Man Method. This is similar to broken link building… with an important twist.<br /><br />Finally, I’ll show you how to get backlinks with Guestographics (one of my all-time favorite link building strategies).<br /><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to get higher rankings and more traffic!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=backlinko">http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=backlinko</a><br /><br /><br />Follow me on Twitter!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Backlinko">https://twitter.com/Backlinko</a>{% endraw %}
