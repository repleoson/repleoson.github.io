I can’t do anything…<br /><br />I see him all the time, ‘cause he’s in every game<br />Winning all the lanes, It makes me just want to log out<br /><br />Alright, I’m back, not gonna stop ’till “win of the day” is done<br />But once again i’m left sitting here thinking, “wow, that burst is dumb”<br />And if I try prolonging it, all I hear is talking<br />“Dead man walking”, never stops taunting it but my only chance is to run<br /><br />How do I recover? ‘Cause wherever I go he goes, no hope, He’s so broke, Have you seen his ratios?<br />But I still remember back when graves was underpowered<br />Nowadays we’ve learned it’s easier to 1v1 a tower<br /><br />Please, I just need win for my first win of the day<br />Just to get enough IP to buy the champ that counters graves<br />Go ahead and call me lame for playing bots my final game<br />Riot stop this it’s really not funny<br /><br />Instrumental by Karaoke Pop Hits: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g0INloIqrs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g0INloIqrs</a>{% endraw %}
