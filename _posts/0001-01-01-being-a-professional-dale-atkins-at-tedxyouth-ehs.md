{% raw %}Dale is an internationally known avalanche and mountain rescue expert who graduated from EHS way back in . . . . Well, let's just say it was a long time ago, back when teenagers could be members of a mountain rescue group. Nearly 40 years later he's still a member of Evergreen's Alpine Rescue Team (ART). Dale turned an avocation into a vocation; a vocation of helping people in the mountains. Dale trains rescuers around the world and has published and presented numerous technical papers and general articles on a diverse range of topics from avalanches, mountain rescue, human factors, risk, to decision-making. Professionally, Dale works for the Swedish rescue company RECCO AB. While he still volunteers with ART, he is also the president of the American Avalanche Association and the vice president of the Avalanche Rescue Commission of the International Commission for Alpine Rescue. From his earliest days with ART, Dale learned to embrace uncertainty, and it is a principle that guides him today.<br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations){% endraw %}
