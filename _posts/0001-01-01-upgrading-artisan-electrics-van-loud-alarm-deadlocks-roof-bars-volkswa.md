{% raw %}In this video we walk you round the upgrades to @Artisan Electrics BRAND NEW VW Caddy van.<br /><br />Make sure you enter our 10k Subscriber Giveaway:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/RCOHFgbMRA4">https://youtu.be/RCOHFgbMRA4</a><br /><br />Artisan Electrics and the team have been in to us before for upgrades to their van, and they've come back with their latest purchase, a 2021 VW Caddy. The team needed a new storage system installed, along with security upgrades to the vehicle.<br /><br />As authorised Rhino Racking Solutions installers, we have fitted the Caddy with a new 3-bar roof system, fully bolted to the vehicle in the factory roof bar positions. These bars are curved to help reduce wind noise when fitted. These allow for a ladder to be mounted, along with the new Rhino PipeTube Pro storage tubes. These fix to the bars, and unlike some pipe storage solutions, are lockable at both ends, allowing for each of access.<br /><br />To upgrade the security on the van, we have fitted Thatcham Approved Deadlocks to the side and rear doors. These are bolted into the van and provide a hook and latch system using seperate keys to add an additional layer of security to the vehicle. These are both a visual deterrent, and also a very strong physical locking device.<br /><br />On top of this, we have also installed our in-house designed Hurricane 360 alarm system. This utilises a siren under the bonnet, and 2 sirens in the rear of the van, which creates an incredibly loud noise should the alarm sensors be trigged. But best of all, the new alarm system is armed and disarmed using the factory key, alongside the factory alarm system. This makes it very easy to increase the security of the vehicle without additional steps.<br /><br />The team have then had the vehicle signwritten with their branding and colours, and will be back for racking later in the year!<br /><br />Thanks for watching our video.<br /><br />If you are interested in a similar install in your vehicle, please feel free to get in touch! <br /><br />:: CBS Automotive / Cambridge Car Audio:: <br />» 01223 56 30 30 <br />» www.cbsautomotive.co.uk <br />» www.cambridgecar.audio <br />» www.facebook.com/SelectCBS/ <br />» www.facebook.com/cambridgecar.audio1/ <br />» twitter.com/CBS_AUTOMOTIVE <br />» www.instagram.com/cambridgecaraudio/ <br />» www.instagram.com/cbsautomotive/<br />» www.tiktok.com/@cambridgecaraudio{% endraw %}
