Saddleback Kids, the children’s ministry at Saddleback Church has developed these fun and creative ways to teach children about God’s word. We are here to help parents connect kids to the content that they learn each weekend at Saddleback Church. These videos can also be used as stand-alone bible lessons that parents can view with their children. We hope you enjoy and learn what God has planned for each of us.{% endraw %}
