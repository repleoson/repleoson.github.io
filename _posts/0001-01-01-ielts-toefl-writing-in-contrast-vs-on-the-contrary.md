{% raw %}A common error people make in the IELTS and TOEFL writing section is mixing expressions. IN this video we look specifically at the expressions ‘in contrast’ and ‘on the contrary’. <br /><br />These expressions are used as transitions to show a difference or an opposite, but they are not interchangeable. Common mistakes include mixing parts (in contrary, on the contrast), or using them inappropriately to mean something else (for example, in contrast when you are showing an opposite situation, or on the contrary to show a different approach or view). <br /><br />Test graders may think you simply memorized these expressions and tried to force them into your writing if you do not use them correctly. In this video, you can see examples of correct usage, as well as other options.<br /><br />Need ideas for your essays?
