Over the course of six decades they have come to embody a spirit of fearless creative independence, ferocious dedication to their fans, and a cheerful indifference to their critics that’s won them a following that spans every culture, generation, and time-zone. A story of gritty determination and courageous defiance of the naysayers, theirs has been an adventure like no other.<br /><br />The band’s immense discography includes the studio albums ‘The Number Of The Beast’, ‘Piece Of Mind’, ‘Powerslave, ‘Somewhere In Time’, ‘Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son’, ‘Fear Of The Dark’, ‘The Final Frontier’ and ‘The Book Of Souls’ which have spawned many classic hits as ‘The Trooper’, ‘Wasted Years’, ‘Hallowed Be Thy Name’, ‘Wasting Love’, ‘Run To The Hills’, ‘Aces High’, ‘Rime Of The Ancient Mariner’ and ‘2 Minutes to Midnight’.<br /> <br />#IronMaiden #TheNumberOfTheBeast{% endraw %}
