{% raw %}I have always liked this song because it tells such a vivid story and at the same time teaches a great lesson. In replying to a child's request there is taught an adult lesson. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son. And he died for us and in all that there was no charge laid to our account.because it was done out of LOVE.{% endraw %}
