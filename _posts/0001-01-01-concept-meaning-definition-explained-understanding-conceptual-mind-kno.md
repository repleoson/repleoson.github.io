{% raw %}What is a CONCEPT? Understanding the Conceptual Knowledge of the Mind is of great benefit to all Spiritual Seekers. A Concept is an idea or mental picture that is agreed upon by society and becomes accepted and integrated into the collective understanding and consciousness. Concepts are a product of the conceptual ego thinking mind that is limited to perceptually created abstractions, language, ideas, and symbols. Through mental observation, a concept is created to describe, explain, and capture reality as it is understood. But a concept, label or name is not what a thing is in reality...
