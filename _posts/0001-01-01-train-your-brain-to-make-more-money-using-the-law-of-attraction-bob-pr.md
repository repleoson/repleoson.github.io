In short, he’s a master thinker. One of his bestselling books is called You Were Born Rich, which is all about finding success in your present, rather than reaching for it in the future. Bob is also featured in the popular film The Secret, one of the most popular self-help films ever made.<br /><br />Bob was a high school dropout who started off his career working low-paying jobs. At age 26, Bob read a book that changed his life: Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. Bob moved from making a couple thousand a year to hundreds of thousands to over one million a year. He’s spoken about his journey around the world and has been featured on a number of TV shows, such as Ellen and Larry King Live.<br /><br />Bob Proctor partnered with attorney Sandy Gallagher to create the Proctor Gallagher Institute. The Institute offers elite programs and coaching courses that teach people how to use the power of their own minds to create the ideal life.<br /><br />Bob says he was going nowhere before he “woke up” to how the universe works. He’s passionate because he figures that if it could work for him, it could work for anyone.<br /><br />I’ve had the pleasure of having Bob on The School of Greatness a couple of times — Episode 835 and Episode 950 — where we talked about how having an abundance mindset naturally creates an abundant life and the practical things we can do to set ourselves up for success. Today, we’re discussing the Law of Attraction — specifically how you can manifest your desires in your life! Every time I have him on the show, I learned so much about money mindset, how to create a thriving business, and more — today’s episode is no different!<br /><br />Join me on Episode 1,090 to learn all about the Law of Attraction, creating wealth, and manifesting abundance with the amazing Bob Proctor!{% endraw %}
