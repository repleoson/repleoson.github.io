{% raw %}ðŸ“± An educational history of the most iconic and important cell phones over the last 3 decades. Starting with the origin of mobiles with the Motorola Dynatec we walk through through the evolution of mobiles in a easy to understand method by showing each major progression and how it was made, whilst also seeing slight adaptions throughout.<br /><br />This was a project in the works for a long a time, I made it originally back in 2015, then spent a whole year on it due to University stopping me from adding new phones. Sorry for missing any. <br /><br />For business inquiries please contact mgnfi.bus@gmail.com<br /><br />mgnfi / mgnfy<br /><br />All images are of fair use, and the design obviously belongs to the company provided.
