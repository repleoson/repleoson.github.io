What documents you'll sign to close on your new home!<br /><br />Timeline:<br />1.  0:46 - Who will be present at closing? <br /><br />2.  4:54 - What happens on the closing day?  <br />The process of closing on a home is a story in your life journey full of new people that will help your dream become your new reality.  Your real estate agent, loan officer, title officer, and their teams are focused on ensuring all the I's are dotted and T's crossed so at the end of the day, you'll have the keys to your new home!  Yay! <br /><br />3.  6:04 - 9 Documents you'll be signing today!  <br />Bring your favorite signing pen, stretch your wrist, and be ready to sign a forest of paperwork for your new home! <br />- Your Closing Disclosure<br />- Warranty Deed/ Title<br />- Proration Documents<br />- Statement of Personal Information<br />- Title Abstract (You saw this before as the Preliminary Title Report, this is the final version)<br />- Truth in Lending Statement<br />- Promissory Note to Repay Your Mortgage<br />- Mortgage/ Deed of Trust<br />- Your Monthly Payment Letter<br /><br />4.  8:38 - When is the closing day?  <br />In your purchase agreement, your real estate agent put a day for closing (generally 30- 45 days from the date of your offer) ask them if you're not sure.  In real estate terms, we call this the COE (Close of Escrow) which means the day everyone is working towards to finalize the sale of your new home. <br /><br />5.  9:19 - Where your closing meeting takes place! <br /><br />6.  10:07 - Is ALL of this REALLY necessary!? <br /><br />7.  10:58 - How to prepare for the closing day! <br />Remember to:<br />- Reread your contracts! <br />- Schedule your final walk-through!  (Ideally you'll complete your final walkthrough 2-5 days PRIOR to the actual closing day!)<br />- Get your funds ready!  You'll likely have one final wire to send to the Title company known as your &quot;cash to close.&quot;  Be sure you make arrangements ahead of time with your bank to ensure the wire is received and posted to your escrow account.  <br />BEST PRACTICE:  Make your final wire 1-2 days PRIOR to your closing meeting! <br />- Your ID cards!  i.e. Drivers License, SSN/ ITIN card, State Issued ID,  Military ID, etc... 2 Forms are of ID are sufficient.  <br />- Verify you TURNED ON all Utilities for the date of your closing! <br />- Process Your Change of Address Cards with the USPS!<br /><br />7.  13:49 - Have FUN!  =)<br /><br />Thank you for watching!  =)<br /><br />Enjoy an amazing day!<br />Andrew Finney<br />Trusted Real Estate Advisor, USMC Veteran <br />License S.0173260<br />Andrew@AndrewFinneyTeam.com <br />#AndrewFinney<br /><br />Andrew Finney Team<br />King Realty Group, Inc.<br />6955 North Durango Drive Suite 1004<br />Las Vegas, NV 89149<br /><br />Disclaimers/ Credits:<br />At the time of production, Andrew Finney, S.0173260, is a real estate salesperson with King Realty Group in Las Vegas, NV.<br /><br />Andrew's videos are his own and do not necessarily represent the views and/ or opinions of KRG.<br /><br />The purpose of Andrew's videos is to educate you and help you make sense of the real estate process.
