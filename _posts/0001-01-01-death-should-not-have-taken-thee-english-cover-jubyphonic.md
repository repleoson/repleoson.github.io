Really a shame.<br />3, 2, 1 Oh!<br /><br />King!<br />What now?<br />Help!<br />Oh what do you want?<br />They!<br />Right..<br />They took the princess and won't give her back!<br />Hero should...<br />Not exist.<br />Hmm, got it!<br />Eh?<br />No need to fear, you be the hero!<br />Set up let down!<br /><br />Jimmying the lock and a brand new stock <br />of any old item to get you going!<br />Party on up and to get you pumped and fight <br />Oh tell me you're just kidding, right?<br />Fine so ever if you're in trouble talk to the peasants, okay?<br />And with a smash go beat that boss down!<br /><br />Wait what now?<br />Boast it and toast it and raise your all your glasses<br />Cuz they all know that I rule all the masses<br />And I'll just be here doing everything for their sake<br />Thinking again, the bigger they are<br />The harder they're overthrown<br />One up and one up and throw up your hands now!<br />Partying hard just to watch them all bow down<br />Hold up a second, didn't hear this at enrollment<br />My paid vacations are-? DELETED DELETED<br />So now we're waiting for the bating of the breathing and the beating of the beastly ol' ultimate boss<br />Say that we're fighting for a cause because I demand<br />Say that we're fighting to keep peace over the land<br />Looking on, fighting from furthest point in the rear<br />Calling your stats out like you're blind or just can't hear<br /><br />Fighting for you and maybe fighting for the peasants too<br />Take a sec to see how hard we fight so you can rule<br />They're falling one by one around me and I'm flashing red<br />I knew my levels just weren't high enough yet...<br />Sorry but your party was wiped out completely, now you're dead<br />O God in heaven, why? Amen.<br /><br />Oh! How could they all die? Really a shame.<br />But I guess I'll give you another try <br />&quot;If at first you don't succeed!&quot;<br />But my king!<br />Don't like the name?<br />No!...This is insane.<br /><br />Eeh?!? Dead people don't have any right to complain!<br /><br />All we got in our castle's stock is really fine to keep us going<br />Partying guys with crazy high levels<br />Oh woah, that's pretty awesome, right?<br />But then again, I stress this one single thing that's ruling as we're dueling<br />Nicely put - oh screw it they're a   <br />HUGE MORON<br /><br />This I get now, humans just like fighting battles<br />And this just a thought (OK?)<br />Say we need to work to better, work together?<br />Is this &quot;The Game of Life&quot; all again?!<br />To reach the next level, you should probably get<br />Experience points, with a thousand, you're set<br />But maybe a backbone wouldn't hurt you to find<br />Don't you falter this time, this is it now, ok?<br />Telissa, Borosso, Zanshi, Paronte<br />All of these magicians used to get your way<br />Calm and quietly I'm always smiling down at thee<br />But politely bragging away, I give my scepter a wave<br />Holit and, Holit and, Holit and, hold it!<br />It's always this spell and it's spelling out &quot;STUPID&quot;<br />It puts the mighty king into a mighty deep sleep<br />And just who do you think you are? This better not be a coup!<br />Hey I'm no hero, and I think I should add...wanting a hero played right, you should just play it yourself!<br /><br />Say that we're fighting for a cause because I demand<br />Say that we're fighting to keep peace over the land<br />Moving on, fighting from furthest point in the front<br />Seeing approval ratings rocketing from one! (WAIT. WHAT THE?)<br />Fighting for views and always fighting for the money too<br />Take a sec to think about what this king really rules<br />They're falling one by one around me and you're red as flames<br />How could they all be dying? Really a shame!<br />Say that we're fighting for a cause because I demand<br />Say that we're fighting so your smile always stands<br />Sliding by, we're always trying harder not to die<br />Scraping up what info on the evil we can find<br />And so today, I stay here guarding like I always do<br />Awaiting one good hero strong enough and true<br />I know you're thinking that I'm hiding on the throne again <br />But in the end I know I'm too weak to win{% endraw %}
