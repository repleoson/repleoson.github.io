{% raw %}Many people believe that doing something good for one person won’t have any effect on the world in general. However, you shouldn’t forget that for that person, the world will change forever, and not only thereby setting in motion the ripple effect of kindness, but also by changing this person’s attitude towards life. I don't know who said it, but I really want to believe that it does work this way!<br /><br />#life_story <br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: <br />cegelnik95@gmail.com{% endraw %}
