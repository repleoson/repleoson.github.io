Such a beautiful day<br />The sun’s shining in a beautiful way<br />gonna take a shower, brush my teeth and<br />Life is ultimately meaningless<br />....Uhh (cough)...<br /><br />but I'll get out of the house<br />Get on the road, top down, hands out<br />Put on my favorite song and nod to the rhythm<br />The planet’s being destroyed by your carbon emissions<br /><br />But I- I- , I’ll head to class<br />try my best on every test til I pass<br />and my grades are screaming in my face - Ayyyy<br />98 percent of what you learn is a waste. <br /><br />I get to hang out with all my friends<br />My friends are the friendliest friends<br />Can't think of a better way to spend my time<br />Your brain is flawed and all your friends will die<br />Nevermind!<br /><br />I’m alive in the greatest nation!<br />So proud of- the exploitation of natives<br />This graceful bird means freedom for all<br />Tell that to the slaves and bald eagles aren't bald<br /><br />I can live in the moment, milk every second<br />at any time you could get clinical depression<br />But I'll just be happy, no matter what’s in store<br />it’s quite genetic and we have no cure <br />uhh- at least<br /><br />(CHORUS )<br />We are young <br />not for long<br />Life is fun<br />It only goes downhill<br />We gotta make the most of it, Make the most of it <br />or you'll regret it<br />We are young <br />For now<br />Life is fun <br />for some people<br />We gotta make the most of it, Make the most of it<br />Good luck<br /><br />Woo! I got a brand new job today!<br />Doin stuff that'll help the economy<br />I'll save money and buy things at the store<br />Banks can crash and capitalism is flawed<br /><br />And it’s all because of my hard work<br />And the thousand advantages you lucked into at birth<br />I put a lotta effort in my resume!<br />Good thing you don't have a black person’s name<br /><br />I'm proud to be a functioning member of society<br />Finally, I can be the citizen I dream to be<br />part of the community, contribute with my tax<br />What could possibly stop me?<br />The shrinking middle class<br /><br />I’ve at least got a nice stable job<br />Until it’s outsourced to china or replaced by a robot<br />OH GOD- Well then I could relax a bit<br />You'll be empty with nothing to distract from it<br /><br />But man I'm a passionate graduate <br />I can be different and I have a career paths to pick from<br />I could be a rapper or an animator if I'm lucky<br />Neither of those will make you happy, trust me<br /><br />I'm able to choose what I pursue<br />You're a slave to people born richer than you<br />Then screw it, I'll keep going in <br />then I'll party on the weekend and sing<br /><br />Thanks to autotune <br /><br />(CHORUS )<br /><br />Life is a wonder<br />You’ll never know the answer<br /><br />Nature is a miracle<br />Natural disasters<br /><br />It’s good to be alive<br />You could wake up with cancer<br /><br />But I'm healthy<br />Healthy people still get cancer<br /><br />I love this show<br />It’s the last episode<br /><br />The sun is shining<br />It’s going to explode<br /><br />Every species is beautiful and unique though<br />Children have malaria thanks to mosquitoes<br /><br />I met a cute girl with a ponytail<br />Statistically that relationship is going to fail<br /><br />I have a wonderful family, it’s like no other<br />You're not special and one day you'll bury your mother<br /><br />No matter what I can find a home!<br />We. Will. All. Die. Alone.<br /><br />There’s amazing potential in every human on earth<br />There’s no escaping the heat death of the universe<br /><br />I don't have to live life based on negative parts<br />No matter how bad they are, they're just thoughts<br /><br />Yeah that’s fair<br />wait really?<br />yeah that seems reasonable<br />wait-wait-wait-wait but you were just telling me<br />whatever man, I dunno, live your life how you want,<br />I'm not forcing you to do anything, I'm just saying.<br />Oh...Well in that case...<br /><br />(CHORUS ){% endraw %}
