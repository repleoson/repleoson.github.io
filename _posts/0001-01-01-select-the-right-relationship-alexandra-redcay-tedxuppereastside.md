{% raw %}Are you ready to talk about relationships? Alexandra Redcay is the executive director to Serise, Inc.  She can be found at Seriseinc.com. Alexandra has over 18 years of direct practice, management, and training experience working in mental health, substance abuse, child welfare, juvenile justice, and education systems.  She is an expert consultant in establishing healthy relationships.<br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations){% endraw %}
