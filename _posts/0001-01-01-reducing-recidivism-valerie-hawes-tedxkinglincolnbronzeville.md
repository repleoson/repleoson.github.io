{% raw %}Reducing recidivism rates in the United States, requires giving second chances to Justice Involved Individuals (also known as Restored Citizens).  These second chances must be extended by offering education, employment, and housing opportunities to individuals that may have a criminal background but have paid their debt back to society.  Valerie shares practical knowledge and experience regarding advocacy work to restore this forgotten population and our communities as a whole. Valerie L. Hawes is a Global Learning &amp; Development Professional.  Valerie has nearly 20 years of speaking/training and development experience working in both the public and private sectors.  She has exceptional facilitation experience having delivered hundreds of presentations in areas including professional development, leadership development, performance management, management training programs, customer service, sexual harassment, and diversity &amp; inclusion.  Valerie’s work history includes managing the training functions for organizations in the consulting, transit and cruise industries.  She holds a Bachelor’s Degree from Park University in Social Psychology and a Master of Human Resources Management from Keller Graduate School of Management. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
