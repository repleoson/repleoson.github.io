{% raw %}In today's video I want to show you Transformer - KAMAZ master with additional caterpillar traction<br />   KAMAZ usually rides tires, but when stuck, uses caterpillars. This is probably the only race car with tracks.<br />   A pair of tracks moved out of the sidewalls of the body and was supposed to help get out of the sand trap or overcome a difficult section of off-road<br /><br />If you like this video don't forget to sucscribe ;)<br /><br />Production Music courtesy of Epidemic Sound www.epidemicsound.com<br /><br />#KAMAZ #truck  #caterpillar{% endraw %}
