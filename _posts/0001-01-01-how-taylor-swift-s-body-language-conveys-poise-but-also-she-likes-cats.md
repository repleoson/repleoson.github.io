{% raw %}ORIGINAL VIDEO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6IYUYYTmeY&amp;ab_channel=extratv">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6IYUYYTmeY&amp;ab_channel=extratv</a><br /><br />ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION: “Extra’s Cheslie Kryst interviews Taylor Swift as she celebrates the release of ‘Red (Taylor’s Version)’ and the short film she directed for the new 10-minute version of her song ‘All Too Well.’ Taylor reacts to fan speculation about who the song could be about and talks about working with Sadie Sink and Dylan O’Brien on the short film. She also teases what’s in store for her appearance on ‘Saturday Night Live’! ‘Red (Taylor’s Version)’ is out now!”<br /><br />Absolutely no one asked me to do this, but in light of Taylor’s recent big release, I decided to make an analysis of an interview done the night of the 12th. Congratulations to @Taylor Swiftfor the massive collection.
