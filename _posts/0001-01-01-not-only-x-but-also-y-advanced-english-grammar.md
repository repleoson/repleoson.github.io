{% raw %}In this video, learn advanced English grammar by adding the expression &quot;not only X, but also Y&quot; to your advanced English vocabulary. <br /><br />First you'll learn what the expression &quot;not only X, but also Y&quot; means. We use this expression to identify two characteristics, traits or points. It's important to note that these two must match. So they're either BOTH positive or BOTH negative. <br /><br />Next we'll look at some example sentences using &quot;not only X, but also Y&quot;. We'll examine the English sentence structure so you can understand the advanced English grammar. <br /><br />We'll look at two different ways you can form this common English expression and how the sentence structure changes with both. <br /><br />Finally, you'll get the chance to practice. <br /><br />By the end of the lesson, you'll feel comfortable and confident using &quot;not only X, but also Y&quot; so you improve your advanced English grammar and sound fluent in English.<br /><br />Please subscribe for more videos to help you learn English and sound like a native English speaker!  <br /><br /><br /><br />Let’s Connect: <br /><br /><br /><br />Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/JForrestEnglish">https://www.facebook.com/JForrestEnglish</a> <br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JForrestEnglish">https://twitter.com/JForrestEnglish</a><br /><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-forrest">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-forrest</a><br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.jforrestenglish.com/">http://www.jforrestenglish.com/</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />Free Guide – Speak English Fluently &amp; Confidently in 6 Easy Steps.
