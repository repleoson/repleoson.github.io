{% raw %}You can make your own crypto ETF between coins you want to hold for the medium to long term. With the right bot settings and a volatile market, you might come out ahead by having a coin rebalance bot sell high and buy low.<br /><br />This video is sponsored by Pionex and they asked me to make an ETF of coins I like, so that's what I did. There are reasons why I picked the coins I did for this video, I realized the explanations for 7 coins would be way too along so I didn't include it. That's just my opinion thought and not financial advice. Do what you want with your money.<br /><br />00:00 Pionex Rebalancing Trading Bot<br />01:56 Why I am using Pionex trading bots<br />03:14 Profiting from a rebalancing bot<br />07:20 How to set up a crypto ETF<br /><br />[Full Value Discord] <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/fvdiscord">https://bit.ly/fvdiscord</a><br /><br />[Earn interest on your crypto] <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://airtable.com/shrCInG4EhCIIc7mj">https://airtable.com/shrCInG4EhCIIc7mj</a><br /><br />Pionex referral (20% off trades): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pionex.com/sign/ref/pSvC5fVWaV">https://www.pionex.com/sign/ref/pSvC5fVWaV</a>{% endraw %}
