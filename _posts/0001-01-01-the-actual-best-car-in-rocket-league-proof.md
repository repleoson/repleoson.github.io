Eventually I discovered then-called JHZER's videos and got super into learning how to freestyle. After a while I joined my first team called Hexicon as a freestyler in around July 2016 and later Pulse in September 2016. My style has changed a bunch over time, nowadays I really enjoy playing mutators along with freestyling with my friends. I'm not huge into competitive but I find that fun as well. Rocket League is a cool game.{% endraw %}
