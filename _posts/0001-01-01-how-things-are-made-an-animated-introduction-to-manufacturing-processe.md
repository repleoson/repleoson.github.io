{% raw %}How are things made? In this video I take a look at the different types of manufacturing processes - forming, casting, molding, machining, joining and additive manufacturing - which are used to create the everyday objects that surround us.<br /><br />Using animations, the video explores a number of different specific manufacturing techniques, like rolling, injection molding, investment casting, sand casting, and 3D printing, and gives an overview of the pros and cons of each, to help better understand how to select the correct manufacturing process.<br /><br />The Efficient Engineer is a channel aimed at mechanical and civil engineers. The mission is to simplify engineering concepts, one video at a time!<br /><br />Follow me on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/efficiengineer">https://twitter.com/efficiengineer</a><br />Support the channel on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/efficientengineer">https://www.patreon.com/efficientengineer</a>{% endraw %}
