{% raw %}A common expression IELTS and TOEFL test takers use in their essays is ‘due to’. Many also use ‘due to the fact that….’ These expressions are often used to replace the word ‘because’. The essay graders see these expressions too often and they know that the writer is trying to score more points on the lexical resource category by not using the simple, everyday word ‘because’. <br /><br />Remember: if you can say something in 1 word, don’t use 2.<br /><br />‘Because’ is a perfectly fine word to use. ‘Due to’ is also fine, though it is not a synonym for ‘because’. <br /><br />In this video, we look at the differences between due to, because of, and because and how to avoid making a mistake, we also look at why you should avoid using the expression ‘due to the fact that’, and when it should be used.<br /><br />Need ideas for your essays?
