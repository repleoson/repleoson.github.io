{% raw %}After traveling all around Scandinavia and visiting various automotive events, we could clearly see that the locals really love their own Nordic car brands, especially one brand in particular - Volvo. And there is no wonder why. Almost all Volvo's up until early 90's were rear wheel drive, robust as hell and pretty darn good looking if you are into &quot;sharp&quot; and &quot;boxy&quot; cars. It's a perfect combination for anyone who wants to build a fun drift car. We had a lot of nice shots with old turbobricks going sideways, parked as stance cars and just still being used as a daily car and that's why we decided to throw some of the clips together and show them off. Enjoy the mixture of 740's, 240's, 940's and some other bricks rolling/drifting around!{% endraw %}
