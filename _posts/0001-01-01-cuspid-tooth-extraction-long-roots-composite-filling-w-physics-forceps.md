{% raw %}www.golden-dent.com<br />877.987.2284<br /><br />Dr. Tim Kosinski<br /><br />The Physics Forceps® are an atraumatic extraction system that provides a simple, predictable and unconventional method of extracting teeth regardless of a practitioner’s extraction experience, or the condition of the tooth, while providing a positive patient experience.<br /><br />The Physics Forceps® operate as an elevator, rather than forceps, using first-class lever mechanics. One handle is connected to a &quot;bumper,&quot; which acts as the fulcrum, that is placed deep in the vestibule. The other handle is connected to the &quot;beak,&quot; which is positioned most often on the lingual or palatal root of the tooth into the gingival sulcus. No aspect of the instrument grasps the crown and there is no advanced elevation needed. Once the instrument is properly placed, the handles are rotated a few degrees with only wrist movement in a slow, steady and controlled manner — no squeezing!<br /><br />The Physics Forceps® are effective in most cases, including badly decayed or broken down teeth, endodontically treated teeth, fractured or fragile teeth, curved or long rooted molars and cuspids, or any tooth that would historically be challenging with conventional instrumentation. The Physics Forceps® are ideal for implantologist that wants to preserve the surrounding bone and tissue in preparation for dental implants.{% endraw %}
