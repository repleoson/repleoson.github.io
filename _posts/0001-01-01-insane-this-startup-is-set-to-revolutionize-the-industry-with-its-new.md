And ELON MUSK Agrees!!!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/sftp-GPp62Y">https://youtu.be/sftp-GPp62Y</a><br /><br />Imagine this; an electric vehicle with a driving range that doesn't reduce throughout the lifetime of the vehicle. Now, imagine that this technology is open source, and will be available to every player in the market ‚Äî whether major or minor.<br /><br />Wait, wait, it doesn't end there. <br /><br />Imagine that these vehicles charge up to 50% faster than all other electric vehicles today, and still cost the same.<br /><br />I know what you're thinking. You probably think this is some, I don't know, science fiction dream dreamt up by Elon Musk or something. <br /><br />But it isn't. This technology could be real, and a real company has just gotten a patent for it. That's right. If everything goes according to plan, this insane digital battery company could be the new Tesla ‚Äî or some variation of Tesla, since they don't actually make these vehicles, and these massively improved vehicles could be coming to a road near you. <br /><br />The amazing technology we've just spent the last thirty seconds or so describing is going to be built by a company named StoreDot. <br /><br />The batteries they are working on are a lot more interesting.  StoreDot, today, is a pioneer of extreme fast-charging battery technology for electric vehicles. The company has been very involved in developing ground-breaking battery technologies based on the design and synthesis of both organic and inorganic compounds.<br /><br />Over the past few years, StoreDot has managed to revolutionize the conventional Li-ion battery by designing and synthesizing proprietary organic and inorganic compounds. By successfully replacing graphite in the cell‚Äôs anode with nano-scale metalloids and by incorporating specially designed and synthesized proprietary organic and inorganic compounds, StoreDot batteries have been able to deliver a lot more miles-per-minute of charging‚Äî which makes the battery extremely easy to charge.<br /><br />How easy, you wonder. <br /><br />___________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />ü§© The Tesla Domain is the Number 1 channel to go when you want to be up to date with the latest Tesla news, rumors, and insights.
