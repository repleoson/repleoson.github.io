I'm very, very well. Thank you. My name is Ronnie. I'm going to teach you something very easy but a little bit confusing and difficult even if you have studied English or grammar for a while. I hear people make this mistake every day. Again, so this is what we're doing: when you should use &quot;she&quot; or &quot;he&quot; or &quot;his&quot; -- sorry -- &quot;her&quot; or &quot;his&quot;. These are two words that a lot of people get confused.<br /><br />First of all, the thing -- or a mistake that a lot of people make is &quot;she&quot; and &quot;he&quot; -- which one's the girl? Which one's the boy? Most of you know that &quot;she&quot; is the girl, but when you speak, you mix it up, and you say, &quot;My mom went to the store. He bought -- &quot; what? He what? Your mom is a &quot;he&quot; now? What happened on the way to the store? Did something happen to your mom that changed it into a &quot;he&quot;? So be careful. &quot;She&quot; is a girl; &quot;he&quot; is a boy. <br /><br />Now, this is the trick. You will remember this forever if you get this. &quot;She&quot; or &quot;he&quot; going to be followed by a verb, okay? So subject + verb. &quot;She&quot; or &quot;he&quot;. So &quot;she likes&quot;, &quot;he hates&quot;, and then, if you want to, you're going to write a noun, or you're going to say a noun. For example, &quot;She likes chickens.&quot; &quot;He hates apricots. He doesn't like them at all.&quot; So when you use &quot;she&quot; or &quot;he&quot;, it's always going to be followed by a verb. When we use &quot;her&quot; or &quot;his&quot;, it's going to be followed by a noun because it is a possessive pronoun. So I can say, &quot;her dog&quot; because &quot;dog&quot; is a noun. Or I can say &quot;his chicken&quot;. Then,  usually, I would use a verb. For example, &quot;Her dog is cute&quot;, or &quot;his chicken -- let's say we put an S -- his chickens are -- these are your verbs. Uh-oh -- sexy!&quot; Sexy chicken time! <br /><br />So if you need to remember, &quot;Oh, my God. Do I say -- do I say 'her' or 'his' or 'she' or 'he'?&quot; Just remember: &quot;she&quot; or &quot;he&quot; plus the verb -- any verb you want, and &quot;her&quot; or &quot;his&quot; plus a noun. If you can remember these two very simple things for English grammar, you're going to be, &quot;Hallelujah, Ronnie. You saved my life.&quot; You're welcome. Stay tuned. Go to www.engvid.com for a quiz on &quot;she&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, &quot;his&quot;, and &quot;hers&quot;. 'Til then.{% endraw %}
