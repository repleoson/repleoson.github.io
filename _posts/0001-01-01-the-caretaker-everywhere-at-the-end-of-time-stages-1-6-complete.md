This stage is most like a beautiful daydream. <br />The glory of old age and recollection. The last of the great days. <br /><br />00:00:00 - A1 - It's just a burning memory<br />00:03:32 - A2 - We don't have many days<br />00:07:02 - A3 - Late afternoon drifting <br />00:10:38 - A4 - Childishly fresh eyes<br />00:13:36 - A5 - Slightly bewildered<br />00:15:38 - A6 - Things that are beautiful and transient<br />00:20:12 - B1 - All that follows is true<br />00:23:44 - B2 - An autumnal equinox<br />00:26:31 - B3 - Quiet internal rebellions<br />00:30:02 - B4 - The loves of my entire life<br />00:34:06 - B5 - Into each others eyes<br />00:38:42 - B6 - My heart will stop in joy<br /><br />STAGE 2 : 00:41:22<br />The second stage is the self realisation and awareness that something is wrong with a refusal to accept that. More effort is made to remember so memories can be more long form with a little more deterioration in quality. The overall personal mood is generally lower than the first stage and at a point before confusion starts setting in. <br /><br />00:41:22 - C1 - A losing battle is raging<br />00:46:01 - C2 - Misplaced in time <br />00:50:44 - C3 - What does it matter how my heart breaks<br />00:53:22 - C4 - Glimpses of hope in trying times<br />00:58:06 - C5 - Surrendering to despair<br />01:03:09 - D1 - I still feel as though I am me <br />01:07:17 - D2 - Quiet dusk coming early<br />01:10:54 - D3 - Last moments of pure recall<br />01:14:47 - D4 - Denial unravelling<br />01:19:02 - D5 - The way ahead feels lonely<br /><br />STAGE 3 : 01:23:17<br />Here we are presented with some of the last coherent memories before confusion fully rolls in and the grey mists form and fade away. Finest moments have been remembered, the musical flow in places is more confused and tangled. As we progress some singular memories become more disturbed, isolated, broken and distant. These are the last embers of awareness before we enter the post awareness stages.<br /><br />01:23:17 - E1 - Back there Benjamin<br />01:27:33 - E2 - And heart breaks<br />01:31:38 - E3 - Hidden sea buried deep<br />01:32:59 - E4 - Libet's all joyful camaraderie<br />01:36:12 - E5 - To the minimal great hidden<br />01:37:53 - E6 - Sublime beyond loss<br />01:40:03 - E7 - Bewildered in other eyes<br />01:41:55 - E8 - Long term dusk glimpses<br />01:45:29 - F1 - Gradations of arms length<br />01:47:00 - F2 - Drifting time misplaced<br />01:51:16 - F3 - Internal bewildered World<br />01:54:45 - F4 - Burning despair does ache<br />01:57:22 - F5 - Aching cavern without lucidity<br />01:58:41 - F6 - An empty bliss beyond this World<br />02:02:19 - F7 - Libet delay<br />02:06:15 - F8 - Mournful cameraderie<br /><br />STAGE 4 : 02:08:53<br />Post-Awareness Stage 4 is where serenity and the ability to recall singular memories gives way to confusions and horror. It's the beginning of an eventual process where all memories begin to become more fluid through entanglements, repetition and rupture. <br /><br />02:08:53 - G1 - Stage 4 Post Awareness Confusions<br />02:31:02 - H1 - Stage 4 Post Awareness Confusions<br />02:52:55 - I1 - Stage 4 Temporary Bliss State <br />03:13:58 - J1 - Stage 4 Post Awareness Confusions<br /><br />STAGE 5 : 03:36:12<br />Post-Awareness Stage 5 confusions and horror. More extreme entanglements, repetition and rupture can give way to calmer moments. The unfamiliar may sound and feel familiar. <br />Time is often spent only in the moment leading to isolation.<br /><br />03:36:12 - K1 - Stage 5 Advanced plaque entanglements<br />03:58:49 - L1 - Stage 5 Advanced plaque entanglements<br />04:21:37 - M1 - Stage 5 Synapse retrogenesis<br />04:42:25 - N1 - Stage 5 Sudden time regression into isolation<br /><br />STAGE 6 : 05:04:32<br />Post-Awareness Stage 6 is without description.<br /><br />05:04:32 - O1 - Stage 6 A confusion so thick you forget forgetting<br />05:26:25 - P1 - Stage 6 A brutal bliss beyond this empty defeat<br />05:48:02 - Q1 - Stage 6 Long decline is over<br />06:09:12 - R1 - Stage 6 Place in the World fades away{% endraw %}
