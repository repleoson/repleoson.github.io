I hope everyone’s weekend has gotten off to a great start. It’s time for our Week In Review. We started the week off with #Bitcoin smashing through the all time high, but we were soon met with some resistance. We were sure to keep you all updated on all of the price movements that occurred. Let’s talk about some of the content that was covered during the week. <br /><br />For starters, I highlighted the most lethal mistakes that newbies (and some veterans) are prone to making during this bull cycle, and how to avoid them. I also gave you all more solid strategies on conquering #crypto gaming and the #metaverse. If you all missed it, I shared one of my most transparent broadcasts yet, where I broke down every gaming project that I’ve invested in. We’ve seen some bullish and bearish movements, but overall the week has been pretty solid. <br /><br />I’m looking forward to next week being even better. Tune in and recap the week with me.  Have a great weekend E.T Fam!<br /><br />00:00 - Doing this will ruin you<br />00:40 - Failing to DYOR<br />01:06 - Buying a token that has already pumped<br />01:34 - Going all-in on micro-caps hoping for 100x gains<br />02:20 - Selling out of your entire position<br />03:36 - This will send BTC parabolic<br />04:05 - Inflation is real<br />04:53 - Macro setup for BTC<br />06:01 - Uncharted territories ahead<br />06:40 - These projects will create billionaires<br />07:10 - Project #1<br />07:50 - Project #2<br />08:42 - Project #3<br />09:10 - Project #4<br />09:44 - Project #5<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This is not financial advice!
