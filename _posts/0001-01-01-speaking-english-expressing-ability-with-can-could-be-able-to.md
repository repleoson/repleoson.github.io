{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.engvid.com/">http://www.engvid.com/</a> In this English grammar lesson, I look at how to use &quot;can&quot;, &quot;could&quot;, and &quot;be able to&quot;, when talking about ability. I explain which term is appropriate, depending on if you're talking about the past, present, or future.{% endraw %}
