Abandoned Dog with frozen paws<br />It was both a horrific and a happy day for a poor puppy named nakio when he was unexpectedly found in an abandoned house with frozen paws. Animal specialists tried and failed to restore his limbs. A vet specialist decided to raise money and make nakio prosthetic legs; she was assisted by the owner of the orthopedic clinic. This is perhaps the most unbelievable animal saving story, but one that made nakio became the first Dog in the world with bionic paws and can do all that other healthy dogs do.Which is the most inspiring animal rescue story? Have you ever helped any animal in need? Let us know in the comment section.<br />#UltimateFact #Facts #Animals</p>
